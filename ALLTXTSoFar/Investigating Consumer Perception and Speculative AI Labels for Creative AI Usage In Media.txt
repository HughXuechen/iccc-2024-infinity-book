Investigating Consumer Perception and Speculative AI Labels for Creative
AI Usage In Media
ASWATH SIVAKUMARAN
The growing importance of Creative AI and its uncertain impact on people necessitates more research. Current
studies mainly focus on technical aspects, neglecting consumer perspectives. This study seeks to explore consumer
perceptions of Creative AI in consumer media and introduces speculative labeling as a potential solution to empower
consumer choice. Through Content Analysis of 32 Creative AI tools and a survey of 40 respondents, insights on
AI’s value, potential job displacement, and the need for AI usage disclosure emerged. These findings informed a
workshop with 7 participants using the newly proposed N-Speculation method and uncovered consumers’ bias against
AI but indifference toward creators. Factors like cost, quality, and the creator (AI or Human) affect purchase decisions.
Consumers favor labeling with clear pictograms and detailed AI usage information. These findings advance our
understanding of consumer preferences and highlight the need for more consumer-centric Creative AI research. This
research underscores the importance of education, addressing bias, and supporting the growth of Creative AI for all
stakeholders.
SAMMANFATTNING
Den ökande betydelsen av Kreativ AI och dess osäkra inverkan på människor kräver ytterligare forskning. Nuvarande
studier fokuserar främst på tekniska aspekter och försummar konsumentperspektivet. Denna studie syftar till att utforska
konsumentens uppfattning av Kreativ AI i konsumentmedier och presenterar spekulativa märkningar som en potentiell
lösning för att stärka konsumentens val. Genom innehållsanalys av 32 Kreativ AI-verktyg och en enkät bland 40
respondenter framkom insikter om Kreativ AI:s värde, potentiell arbetsdislokation och behovet av information om
AI-användning. Dessa resultat utgjorde grunden för en workshop med 7 deltagare som använde den nyligen föreslagna
N-Speculation-metoden och avslöjade konsumentens fördomar mot AI men likgiltighet gentemot skapare. Faktorer
som kostnad, kvalitet och skapare (AI eller människa) påverkar köpbesluten. Konsumenten föredrar märkningar
med tydliga piktogram och detaljerad information om AI-användningen. Dessa resultat fördjupar vår förståelse av
konsumentpreferenser och understryker behovet av mer konsumentcentrerad forskning om Kreativ AI. Denna forskning
betonar betydelsen av utbildning, att hantera fördomar och att stödja tillväxten av Kreativ AI för alla intressenter.

INTRODUCTION
There are a few different positions on the spectrum of how Creative AI v. human creatives will play out: On the more
technocentric end of the spectrum AI takes over and creativity is no longer an activity exclusive to humanity; on the
more anthropocentric end, Creative AI is seen as just a fad, creativity is innately human [59], and any attempts to
sever such a bond is a foolish endeavor1. However, more realistically, the future of creativity and AI lies somewhere in
between: AI becomes the next big tool that enhances human creativity through disruptive technological means, where
AI acts as more of a tool or colleague for co-creation rather than a full-out replacement of their human alternative.
Early examples of this can already be seen in a multitude of areas and content types where Creative AI has been
used in Hollywood productions [74], high budget TV shows [42, 60], a Netflix short-film [6], magazine covers for
Cosmopolitan [49] and The Economist [80], large scale marketing campaigns [13, 19], imitating the song style of
well-known music artists [2, 52], reading the news in place of newscasters on live TV [65], published academic papers
[58, 61, 67], and comic books [40] (to name a few). While these uses of Creative AI may either be assistive to human
creators or have unmatured outputs while used in isolation, it is important to note that this is only the beginning of
such a technology, or in other words, this is the least technologically capable Creative AI will ever be. While none
of the above uses of Creative AI have had any substantial social backlash, the use of Creative AI is a mixed bag. For
example, in February of 2023, Clarkesworld2 had to stop accepting submissions due to a large influx of AI-created
stories [3, 43]. Similarly, multiple online art community websites have completely banned AI-generated art from being
hosted on their platforms after artists dissented against the presence of AI-created art [8, 87]; However, there has been
no widely reported uproar among consumers of such media that has used Creative AI.
Further, despite the plethora of studies surrounding the more technical aspects of Creative AI, research has seldom
focused on consumerist aspects of Creative AI. The few studies surrounding people (let alone consumers) are often
focused on the broader studies of perception, creating art with AI, or the legal/ethical/moral or similar aspects. As seen
above, there are already various areas where AI has been used in mainstream media, from web articles to high-budget
TV shows. This means that consumers are now going to be thrust into an era of products that they would spend their
money on without knowing or even understanding the implications they might bring. Similar to consumers choosing
organic food, produce that treats farmers ethically, or high energy efficiency electronics, consumers are often big
decision makers that can move and demand that companies follow policies that are in line with their values (such as
eco-friendly or pro-LGBTQ). However, it is currently unknown what might these values be, or in other words, what do
consumers think about Creative AI? However, simply knowing these perceptions is only half as good if we do not know
what to do with this data and how it could be used to positively affect the stakeholders targeted by this study. Thus, this
thesis seeks to be a preliminary study on the perception of Creative AI on consumers and, using those understandings,
aims to provide a route towards furthering consumer choice and education through AI labels.
This thesis attempts to fulfill the above research goals by first reviewing the relevant literature. The background
section sets up definitions of important keywords: Creativity, Artificial Intelligence, Creative AI, and Consumers,
and also reviews the existing literature surrounding consumers within the context of Creative AI. As this thesis looks
to AI labels as a possible solution, the background section also investigates consumer labeling more broadly and uses
those generalized insights to establish AI labels as an appropriate solution and inform their designs used during later
methods of data collection. Three methods were followed to collect data and validate hypotheses; A content analysis of
32 widely available Creative AI tools was performed to understand the capabilities and relevant properties of existing
1The terms "dystopia" and "utopia" were initially considered. However, the use of these terms has been rescinded as they view Creative AI from a lens of
extreme desirability/undesirability. This paper seeks to serve as, and recommends future studies to be, an unbiased work of academia aimed at furthering
research rather than tilting the scales of acceptance.

AI tools. This content analysis provided insights into how AI could change the creative landscape, such as establishing
if Creative AI can only be assistive or full replacements or replace only some jobs/tasks usually allocated to humans.
The content analysis was used to design a survey questionnaire that was used to collect information about consumer
perceptions. General consumer perceptions and attitudes were established and revealed a mostly confused yet curious
population. Further, the survey also established the usage of labels (or declarations in general) for media that uses
Creative AI (both digital and physical) as not only a viable but an essential request by consumers. In the second phase
of this study, an N-Speculative workshop will be used (1) to validate the perceptions and attitudes obtained during
the survey and obtain more qualitative data, and (2) to generate label designs through co-speculation to understand
what elements consumers would like to find in such label designs. The data obtained from the workshop was analyzed
using thematic analysis (for the discussions) and content analysis (for the label designs). The workshop provided
further understanding (and validation) of the survey data and dove deeper into the fears, indifference, and curiosities of
the participants; the co-speculation activity provided label designs that showed that above all else, consumers want
pictograms for easy understanding, and want to be provided information on how Creative AI was used, to understand
how the media consumed would align with their [still developing] morals and personal ethics.

BACKGROUND
This section of the thesis reviews existing and relevant literature and sets up definitions that will set the scope and
delimitations of this study. A review of the background literature shows that most studies currently are focused on the
technical aspects of Creative AI and not so much on how it affects people. The background section also covers the
two important definitions of this paper: Creative AI and Consumer. These definitions are not built out of thin air but
are derived from logically assembling ideas and definitions from various literature. This section also introduces the
relevant literature on speculative design that will be used to establish the newly proposed method of N-Speculation in
the next section (sec. 3).
2.1
Definitions
Across scientific literature, there exists vast disputes and postulations of definitions. Such semantic dissonance often
leads to disagreements, not over the actual subject matter, but over misunderstandings [53]. Thus, key terms are defined
prior to the discussion of the subject matter.
2.1.1
Artificial Intelligence. There exist a plethora of definitions for what constitutes AI [25, 47]. The most widely
accepted (or recognized) definition of these is often attributed to Marvin Minsky3 [23]:
The performance of tasks, which, if performed by a human, would be deemed to require intelligence.
This definition is chosen as the basis for defining AI in this project due to (i) it’s non-reliance on the technical aspects
of AI, (ii) being broadly accommodating of various ideas, (iii) wide acceptance in the academic community [23], (iv)
it’s suitable congruence with Creative AI, and (v) it’s congruence with the definition of creativity used in this project
(2.1.2).
2.1.2
Creativity. Just as with AI, the definition of creativity has eluded a general consensus, altering its perspective
to suit the relevant study [85]. Taking a similar approach to locating a definition of AI, the most common definitions of
creativity and their respective uses were studied [12, 85]. From these, the most widely accepted and suitable definition
[15] was identified:
3Though this definition is widely attributed to Marvin Minsky, the source of this definition is unclear [86].
3
Aswath Sivakumaran
Creativity is the ability to come up with ideas or artifacts that are new, surprising, and valuable. ‘Ideas’
here include concepts, poems, musical compositions, [...] and so on. ‘Artefacts’ include paintings,
sculptures, steam engines, [...] – and many other things you can name.
This definition is highly suitable due to its characteristics of (i) not specifying a particular creator viz. the creator
does not have to be human, (ii) not imposing strict criteria on who or what is creative, and (iii) approaching creativity
from the angle of ideas and products (cf. "Artefacts"), i.e., outputs. These outputs can also more broadly include the
outputs of generative AI such as AI art, AI generated textual content, AI video scenes, etc. Further, this definition also
provides appropriate criteria for what constitutes creativity: new, surprising, and valuable; "New" here can seem to
mean anything that was not previously created, "Surprising" here means that the artifact is in some way surprising, for
example, due to the way it was created, how it was created, or due to an abstract and non-discernible reason; "Valuable"
here means that the artifact has some value. This "value" can be financial, sentimental, culturally important, or any
other such value.
2.1.3
Creative AI. Using the definitions of AI and Creativity listed in sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 respectively, we
may appropriately splice them together to generate a usable definition of Creative AI. Looking at the definition of AI,
the word "tasks" can conveniently be assumed to include (as a subset) "creative tasks" and replace intelligence with
"Creativity"4 to better suit the needs of this project. Now, the keyword "Creative" can be defined using the selected
definition of creativity, and organically arrive at a definition of Creative AI:
The performance of tasks to generate outputs which, if performed by a human, would be deemed to require
Creativity5, where Creativity is defined as the ability to come up with or generate, ideas or artifacts that
are new, surprising, and valuable e.g. concepts, poems, musical compositions, art, film, or computer
code.
2.1.4
Who Is A Consumer? Just as with the previous definitions, this core term also requires some definitions to
be set up. Unlike the above terms though, there does not appear to be much discussion on the attempting to define
what consumer means or encompasses. In a dictionary, "consumer" is defined simply as "one that consumes" [57]. A
similar sentiment is reflected in the literature [88] where the lack of definition (s) often lands on authors settling for a
general definition based on the wider literature [36] or one that is specific to the respective paper or study. This study
takes the latter approach as the semantics of the word are outside the study scope, while the need for a definition is
necessary for providing the required context to successfully study the subject matter and successfully interpret the
results. Thus, in this paper consumer is defined as:
An individual who consumes media content (simply media hereon) by paying for media through a
monetary-based transaction (money for media), including but not limited to, purchasing physical/digital
media through a one-time purchase, paying a monthly subscription, or using an ad-supported service
where the individual is presented with an advertisement that temporarily halts consumption.
From the above definition, it can be questioned what "consumption" refers to. Hence, the opportunity is taken to also
define consumption as:
4While it is still widely debated if creativity and intelligence are in any way correlated [12, 26], such an exploration is outside the scope and requirements
of this project. Additionally, since "Artificial" and "Intelligence" are not being discussed in isolation but rather as a singular term, creativity and
intelligence can be interchanged.
5Creativity (and by extension Creative, Creation) has been used with an uppercase "C" to indicate that this refers to the definition provided in the paper
and differentiate it from the dictionary noun which has also been used in relevant places. The use of the uppercase "C" also subscribes to the notation of
artificial intelligence as AI (in uppercase letters).

Investigating Consumer Perception and Speculative AI Labels for Creative AI Usage In Media
The act of experiencing media either, actively or passively, including but not limited to, listening to vinyl
actively, listening to music in the background while performing a different main task, streaming a movie,
reading a book, playing a video game, reading an article, etc.
2.1.5
Critical Reflection On Definitions’ Impact On Study Framing. While the various advantages of these
definitions are provided in the terms’ respective sections, this section provides some critical perspectives and limitations
on the use of these definitions, to complement and complete the construction of these terms. Similar to any definitions
found across literature, these definitions will also be subject to interpretation, introspection, and criticism. For example,
it might be argued that using Minsky’s definition of AI might be too simplistic since there is no measurement of
what constitutes intelligence, which leads to a situation where the study does not take a clear stance on the nature
of intelligence; it may then be argued by some that, by their own definitions of intelligence, Creative AI cannot be
intelligent (or creative). Beyond an acknowledgement, this study is not concerned in exploring of these potential
drawbacks since the provided definitions provide enough context for the study activities to be performed and the results
to be interpreted. However, these arguments are welcomed as they advance not just the Creative AI research, but also
adjoining areas such as creativity research and semantics.
2.2
Consumerism And Creative AI
Creative AI has been around for almost a decade [18], though it entered into the mainstream public discourse only
around 2022 [31] and sparked major discussions about art [7], creativity [7, 45], and its impact on creatives [7, 24].
While these discussions are far from conclusive, the academic literature has been lacking in the context of the impact
that such technology creates on people. Outside of technical studies, most people-focused literature centers around
perception of AI generated art [29, 34, 39, 59, 62, 69], the enhancement of creative efforts using AI [5, 41, 48, 50, 51],
or explorations of legal areas such as copyright or ownership [32, 54]. The sparsity of literature that persists indicates
that efforts have seldom taken place to understand the direct impact of this emerging technology on the various
stakeholders. While some stakeholders have received some research recognition, for example, Twitter users [38],
various creative professionals [51, 62] and non-creative professionals [30, 89], research around some stakeholders,
such as consumers, is largely absent. Consumers are an extremely vital part of not just free markets, but also of the
same creative industries that are being affected by creative AI: consumer demand and choice dictate, the price, quality,
quantity, type, etc. of various creative products and endeavors. Given the lack of research surrounding Creative AI and
consumerism, this study attempts to provide preliminary insights on the subject matter. Further, with "consumerism"
being a wide field of study, focus is placed on consumer choice, specifically an explorative overview of the attitudes of
consumers on the use of Creative AI in the products or content they purchase or consume.
2.3
AI And The Need For Informed Consumer Choice
Current research shows a clear perception bias against AI-generated content: people are more likely to favor works
created by humans [34, 69]. However, research also shows that humans cannot tell apart AI-generated content from
human-made content [29, 34, 73]. Based on this dichotomy it is fair to assume that consumers might want to know
if AI was used in the products they purchased. Providing consumers with information that enables them to make
choices is not new. Labeling has been chosen for this project as labels, such as eco-labeling, have shown to significantly
affect consumer choice [14, 78]. Nutrition labels, eco-labels, ingredient lists, country of origin, parental ratings, and
region numbers for DVDs, are just some of the kinds of information provided to consumers for them to make informed
purchase decisions. Similarly, "AI labels" would provide consumers a say in choosing to purchase AI created works
since AI has similarly massive effects, such as for example, affecting livelihoods [30]. In fact, 2023 the EU commission
5
Aswath Sivakumaran
has also floated to tech companies the idea of labeling AI-produced content [46]. It is fair to hypothesize that consumers
might also want to be informed about AI usage. Once such speculation is accepted, questions such as the following arise:
Would consumers have to be provided with information on whether Creative AI tools were used in the creation of a
painting, a blog post, a YouTube video, or even clothing? What information, if any, would they like to be provided with?
It can be seen certain organizations have already begun to take an active step to provide this kind of information; Wired
Magazine has declared that it will disclose the use of AI-generated tools [64], CNET has created the "AI Assisted"
declaration [37], and DeviantArt tags artwork made using generative AI [77]. While no study exists yet to determine
if people would like to be informed about the use of Creative AI technology, the subject matter it is certainly worth
exploring.
2.4
Exploring Consumer Choice Information Enhancement Through Speculative Workshops
Speculative design aims to utilize current understandings to imagine preferable futures [27]. Speculative design has
often been (rightly) criticized for its lack of public/stakeholder inclusion and producing showpieces meant to be
exhibited [44]. However, this speculative design approach can be a useful to study and understand future possibilities
when used as a tool for prediction rather than imagination and serves as a vital method for exploration, examination, or
a reflection of these future possibilities. The power, capability, and future prominence of AI have been established
throughout the background section; however, this study bases itself on scarce literature, and as a result, needs to obtain
data to make these predictions as accurate as possible. Unlike other speculative studies, this study does not aim to be
critical or produce thought experiments [11], but rather (preliminarily) provide a seamlessly continuous ’current’ and
’future’ picture. With speculative design on one end and more traditional research-driven design on the other, there
does not appear to be a design research method that serves a more temporally immediate purpose, viz. covering only
probable futures rather than a range of probable to possible futures (ref. fig. 1)[21]. Thus, this study proposes a new
design research method called Near-future Speculation (or N-Speculation) that builds on the existing foundational idea
of speculative design [27] but is less critical, less aesthetic focused, research-oriented, employs the participatory aspect
of co-speculation, and is more temporally immediate. Further, this speculative method seeks to anchor the outcomes in
a more near and probable future, thereby aiming to bridge the gap between traditional design research and speculative
design research by providing the wider scientific body with literature that can be used as traditional scientific reference
and as design inspiration. The need for this new type of speculative design method arises because traditional speculative
design methods are not very suited for scientific study, while traditional design research is too grounded in existing
theory and data. N-Speculation thus provides a middle ground where speculative design allows users the freedom to
venture beyond the problem-solution model of traditional design research, while also anchoring them to theory and data
rather than the fantastical lands created by traditional speculation; this combination allows researchers the flexibility
to test concepts that are not fully understood or well-studied, such as in this case consumers choice empowerment
through AI labels. Through N-Speculation, researchers no longer need to wait for concrete scientific studies to test
concepts and hypotheses that feel like they could work but there exists a lack of existing literature.
While the type of approach has been critically evaluated to be N-Speculation design, a delivery method must also be
chosen. Workshops as the method of choice for prospective and ’unstructured’ domains have been well documented
and studied, including their use in participatory design [91]. Consumers are central to the results and future use of this
study and are also the core stakeholders to any applications of this research; As a result, a collaborative workshop must
be conducted where, though the researcher is in control, participants ’drive’ the workshop [20].

METHODOLOGY
This section will describe the methods in detail. Three methods were chosen, each serving as a chaining link between
each other: Content Analysis, Survey, and N-Speculative Design Workshop. First, a brief content analysis of some
widely available Creative AI tools will be conducted; this is done to understand the current capabilities of these AI
tools, such as if they could replace any jobs entirely/partially. The information obtained from this will also aid in
designing the types of labels that will be used in the survey and the design workshop. Next, a survey will be conducted
to understand the perceptions of consumers on various aspects of Creative AI. The data from this will also be used to
inform the creation of the speculative discussion prompts that will be used during phase 1 of the N-Speculative design
workshop, and the questionnaires prior to the start and at the end of the workshop. Finally, the workshop will serve to
collect data on consumer perceptions (phase 1) that can be cross-checked with the survey data and provide insights
into the design of speculative consumer labels for AI usage.
3.1
Content Analysis And Survey Informing Label And Workshop Design
The survey and content analysis both provided insights into two different perspectives on the core issues of the study,
consumers, and AI tools (respectively). The data acquired from these two methods informed the design of the labels
and the speculative discussion prompts to be used in the workshop. There are two sides to this study: AI and People.
To look at each side, first, a content analysis of some well-known Creative AI tools and technology is carried out
to understand their present capabilities and their potential future uses; then a survey was conducted based on these
potential future capabilities to get a picture of how humans would react to these and understand how they perceived the
various aspects of these technologies and their implied consumer use.
3.1.1
Content Analysis. A content analysis was performed due to its flexibility in interpreting largely unstructured
and varied qualitative data. The following criteria were applied to select which tools would be analyzed:
7
Aswath Sivakumaran
(1) Must be available to the general public either as a deployed tool, or compliable source code. Thus, tools that are, for example,
available only to enterprise customers are not included in the analysis.
(2) Must have been publicly and openly available (incl. no waitlists) before August 1, 2023. The excludes tools that are "coming
soon", "closed beta", "invite only", or "early access" as these tools are still in the very early stages of development and can be
buggy, leaving their capabilities to become improperly evaluated.
(3) Tools must utilize Creative AI, as defined in 2.1.1. This means that AI tools such as Photoshop’s content-aware fill, automation
tools, or tools that utilize more generic AI do not qualify.
(4) "Embedded versions" of the same tool are counted as one tool. For example, Adobe Firefly has been integrated into Photoshop,
so Photoshop is not counted as a separate tool. However, this does not include implementations of the underlying technology
such as OpenAI’s GPT models.
Understanding the capabilities of these tools will also aid in understanding how AI could change the creative
landscape; for example, if Creative AI can only be assistive today rather than a full human replacement, or which media
(books, music, video games, etc.) can be impacted by Creative AI in the near future and those that cannot. Such data
from the content analysis informed the questions of the survey.
3.1.2
Survey Questionnaire. An online survey was conducted using an online survey tool6 to understand how
AI Usage labels in Consumer Items influenced consumers, and the importance that they place on various parameters.
The survey consists of 14 questions7, 8 primary questions aimed at addressing the survey goals, and 6 additional
demographic questions to better inform the survey findings due to use of convenience sampling. The survey included a
question where the three viable combinations discovered from the Content Analysis (ref. section 3.1.1) were included
as types of declarations that consumers might want to see (ref. table 8 in Appendix C.2):
∙ 100% Human Creation and AI-Free: This option indicates that no AI was used. Though presented as different
options, they are effectively two sides of the same coin.
∙ AI Assisted: AI has in some way helped in the creative process but not fully produced it.
∙ AI Produced: AI has fully produced the Creation.
Everybody can be a consumer of some creation that has, is, or going to, use Creative AI technology. This may
include (but is not limited to) books, music, art, film, etc. Using our definition of Creativity, we can say that any work
that satisfies that definition can be considered "Creative Work". Hence the population of such a survey will include any
person who can consume Creative work, where consumption is in a manner appropriate to that particular work (ex.
Watching a film is appropriate but listening to a painting may not be). Since the population of this survey is non-specific,
non-random convenience sampling is both suitable and advantageous for being quick and open to a wide array of
respondents [35]. The survey was distributed primarily via social media channels (LinkedIn, Instagram), online forums,
and personal IM platforms.
3.2
N-Speculation Design Workshop
A two-hour N-Speculation Design workshop was conducted to (1) determine current attitudes and perceptions of
consumers towards Creative AI, and (2) Understand what aspects of AI Use consumers would like to be informed
about through labels. Participants did not need to meet any specific criteria as anyone can be a consumer. Participants’
demographics (ref. table 2) were collected to better inform the results of the workshops. The workshop consisted of 4
phases:
(1) Pre-Workshop Quantitative Perception Measurement: Participants were provided a 9-item questionnaire containing
multiple choice questions that evaluated various aspects of their perception or attitude towards Creative AI. This data is
6The tool used was QuestionPro.
7Survey respondents reported not understanding what Question 7 meant, thus this data was discarded.

collected to evaluate and compare these various aspects before and after receiving more information on the subject matter to
see if, upon learning more, user perceptions and attitudes are altered. The questionnaire can be found in table 11 in Appendix
D.3.
(2) Familiarization through discussions: In this phase participants discussed their feelings, thoughts, attitudes, and perceptions
toward various aspects of Creative AI. Participants were given a speculative discussion prompt (ref. table 10 in Appendix D.1)
each consisting of a unique scenario that would trigger various feelings, ethical quandaries, thought experiments, etc. Prompts
were changed when discussions died down. This phase got participants acquainted with as many viewpoints as possible to (i)
broaden their informed decision-making for phase 3, and (ii) check if their perceptions had changed during phase 4.
(3) Co-Speculative Label Design: During this phase participants were provided with a worksheet and the following speculative
scenario:
"In the year 2035 Generative8 AI use has become mainstream in all forms of media production. This has led to some
debate in society on consumer choice. You are all designers of an organization that is tasked with designing a label
that seeks to promote consumer choice, in a manner similar to how eco-labels empowered consumers to choose more
eco-friendly alternatives in the 2020s."
The above scenario is used by participants to design labels for a future where the use of Creative AI requires to be declared
in some way. Participants were provided with 15 minutes to design their labels. Post this, participants would discuss in the
larger group the thought process behind their label designs, and either ask/answer questions, or provide feedback to other
participants. At the end of these discussions, participants place their worksheets at the center of the table and use the green
voting dots to vote for the design they like the most (one vote per participant).
(4) Post-Workshop Quantitative Perception Measurement: Participants are provided with an identical questionnaire to the
pre-workshop session to measure any changes (if at all) in their perception of the various aspects measured in phase 1.
3.2.1
Label Design. Using the results from the Content Analysis and Survey Questionnaires, five labels are designed
to be used on mockups of physical and digital media. The types of these labels were determined from the content
analysis of the 32 AI tools. The messaging for each of the labels was based on the data from the survey, such as for
example, the label "100% Human Creation" contained the tagline "Human creativity was valued" as a reflection of
the sentiments echoed in the qualitative survey data. All labels were designed to primarily showcase the variety in
aesthetics, information design, content structure, and target applications. The icons and layout used are arbitrary and
only serve the purpose of presenting the label concepts clearly to the workshop participant. Color was purposefully
avoided to reduce the number of variables being studied.
8Generative AI was used here as it was more readily understood by participants in comparison to the term "Creative", though the results were still in line
with the study definition of Creative AI.

ethical production of creative items and is against the replacement of
humans by AI. This label is the same as the one above, though informing
the consumer from a human standpoint.

two above.
AI Produced
Only AI has created
this product
The label is a box divided into two parts. The top two-thirds contain
the title "AI Produced" and the descriptive tagline "The product was
produced by an AI". The bottom third contains information on the AI
"Tools" used. The label consists of no icons and has perforated edges
simply to create aesthetic variety when presented to the workshop par-
ticipants.
AI-Assisted
Both human beings

this product
The label consists of a box divided into three parts. A full-height and
one-fifth-width box contains an icon of a human and AI hand one above
the other to signify a Human-AI connection. The remaining width is
divided into two almost equal parts. The top half consists of the label title
"AI-Assisted" and a descriptive tagline: "The creation of this product
was assisted by AI". The remaining bottom half is dynamic and changing
depending on the application. It consists of two lines placed vertically,
the first indicates the "Assisted Areas" to signify what part of the product
utilized AI, and the bottom text lists the AI "Tools" used.

Analysis Of N-Speculative Workshop Data. The data collected from the workshop was analyzed using two
methods:
Thematic Analysis. Qualitative data gathered during the discussion phases was analyzed using thematic analysis
[16]. Here, the captured audio data was transcribed using Microsoft Word Online’s built-in transcription feature.
This text was then be checked against the recordings for any errors. The transcripts were then be imported into QDA
Miner Lite coding software. The coding process took place in two phases; first broad coding was performed to simply
highlight important or interesting parts of the data without worrying if they fit with other codes. After this, codes were
amalgamated to better fit into more encompassing yet well-defined codes, which were then categorized into themes.
The textual data was revisited to ensure that all the relevant data was coded and categorized.
Content analysis. Content analysis was performed on the labels designed by the participants. While this is less
well-defined than thematic analysis, this analysis looked at which design elements were used, the reasonings behind
them, the kind of information depicted, etc. to discover emerging themes.

RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
In this section, the results obtained from (1) Content analysis of various Creative AI tools (sec. 4.1.1 - 4.1.2), (2)
Survey of consumer perception and attitudes towards Creative AI (sec. 4.1.3 - 4.1.6), and (3) Workshop containing
discussions to assess consumer attitudes and behavior (sec. 4.2 - 4.2.4), co-speculative activity aimed at understanding
11
Aswath Sivakumaran
what consumers would like to see in AI labels (sec. 4.3), and the pre and post workshop perception comparison (sec.
4.4), is presented.
4.1
Content Analysis And Survey Informing Label And Workshop Designs
A content analysis of 32 Creative AI tools was performed. These tools were categorized according to the media
they output, transparency, and pricing model. A list of these tools and their classifications can be found in table 5 in
Appendix B. Post this, an online survey collected data from 40 respondents (𝑛 = 40). The demographic data of the
participants can be found in table 6 in Appendix C.2. Questions 1-5 used a 5-point Likert scale (0-4) to measure the
importance of various aspects. While referring to this data, negative terms are utilized for data reported as "Not at all
important" and "Slightly important", positive terms are utilized for data reported as "Very important" and "Extremely
important", and neutral/undecided terminologies are utilized for data reported as "Moderately important".
4.1.1
AI Tools Offer Capabilities In A Broad Variety Of Mediums Though In Varying Capacities. Analyzing
the 32 chosen AI tools it can be seen that they are capable of generating images9 (𝑛𝐼 = 12), code (𝑛𝐶 = 5), text
(𝑛𝑇 = 4), speech audio (𝑛𝑆 = 4), music (𝑛𝑀 = 3), video (𝑛𝑉 = 4), and game assets (𝑛𝐺 = 2). Looking at the tools
it can also be seen that most tools will be used in collaboration with human creatives, though some tools, particularly
image generators, can be used standalone and entirely replace certain creative professions (such as junior illustrators);
Of course not using any of these tools automatically results in the work being 100% Human Creation or AI-Free.
4.1.2
Paid And Proprietary, Free And Open Source. Various pricing models are employed by various tools
with the large majority (𝑛𝑃 𝑃 𝑈+𝑃 𝑇 𝑈+𝐹 𝑚 = 19) charging for use in some manner. The most widely employed pricing
model is the freemium pricing model (𝑛𝐹 𝑚 = 10). For tools that cannot be used as a limited free version, most tools
interestingly employed a Pay-Per-Use model instead of a Pay-To-Use model, where in the former, users are charged for
the usage amount which may be measured by the number of "compute units", time of usage, power usage, etc. This result
might be used to infer that the cost of development or setting up the model/tool is negligible, thus potentially making
wide scale use of Creative AI models a feasible alternative. From table 5 (Appendix B) it can also be seen that most
tools are closed source (𝑛𝐶𝑙 = 27) with only a small minority of tools being open source (𝑛𝑂 = 5). Comparing the
pricing model and transparency, it can be seen that all paid tools are closed source (𝑛𝑃 𝑃 𝑈 ∪𝑛𝑃 𝑇 𝑈 ∪𝑛𝐹 𝑚 ∩𝑛𝐶𝑙 = 19).
While this is bad for consumer transparency, it makes sense for the tools developers who would want to protect their
market position, business, and the cost of development; however, there does not seem to be a reason why some free
tools are closed source (𝑛𝐹 ∩ 𝑛𝐶𝑙 = 6). Information on how these tools operate is important (though not vital) to
consumer awareness. On the flip side, the presence of free and open-source tools means that businesses can implement
Creative AI tools in any manner they wish to see fit to their organization which, perhaps, might bring down costs
further when compared to the already reduced cost of developing proprietary AI tools over using human creatives
in the long term. Due to a combination of the unviability or business unsustainability of companies disclosing trade
secrets of how their AI models operate, and how easy it is to implement these models at scale for low cost, the proposal
of consumer labels for AI is a convenient compromise that allows companies to not disclose trade secrets while the
consumers still receiving information that helps them make choices based on their personal choices and morals.
4.1.3
Consumers View Physical And Digital Media In The Same Light In The Context Of AI Usage. There
does not appear to be much overall difference between the need for consumers to know AI use information in physical
and digital media with a ∆¯𝑥 = 0.13 (¯𝑥𝑝ℎ𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 = 2.8, ¯𝑥𝑑𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 2.93) slightly in favor of digital media. This lack of
difference was also noted during the workshop though some participants noted that they would pay less for digital art

Investigating Consumer Perception and Speculative AI Labels for Creative AI Usage In Media
created by AI such as, for example, 𝑃5: "If it’s a real painting, you can see the texture. That I’ll pay more [for]." Looking
at the individual scores however, we can see that consumers would like to be informed about what AI tools were used
for creation and if AI has either produced or assisted in those creations more so in digital media as when compared to
physical media products. Interestingly when it came to finding out compensation information, on average consumers
did not want to know this information for digital media; though the exact reason is not clear (discussed in more detail
in 4.1.4). Further, looking at the average scores for each area investigated (Figure 4 and table 7 in Appendices C.3 and
C.4 respectively) we can see that on average it is moderately important for consumers to know if the details of AI used
in the creation of the media they consume/purchase. Overall, though there is some variation in what they would like to
see and where they would like to see it, from figure 5 in Appendix C.5 it can also be seen that on average consumers
would like to see labels in fairly equal measure on both digital and physical media.
4.1.4
Less Than Half Of Consumers Want To See Compensations For Loss Of Livelihoods. The survey data
indicates that most respondents either cannot say or do not agree that livelihoods lost to AI should be compensated. In
the survey, only 35% (𝑛𝑌 𝑒𝑠 = 14) agreed that people replaced by Creative AI systems should be compensated. While
only 3 of the 14 respondents provided a reason (and thus nothing significant can be concluded from it), all 3 responses
talk about the ethics/morality of the situation:
(1) "A lot of AI is already producing materials based on humans’ work."
(2) "People need jobs. Just something to set them up to find another job or provide training to reach new areas".
(3) "I don’t think people should be replaced by AI at all to begin with unless it is for something that betters the planet & is overseen
ethically by humans."
In contrast, 20% (𝑛𝑁𝑜 = 8 responded that they would not be in favor of such compensations. When asked why,
one respondent compared humans being replaced by Creative AI systems to painters being replaced by the invention
of photography, or postal works to email: "Technology will always be changing the job market, why is AI different
here?". Another respondent, who interestingly reported to be a graphic designer and was well aware of the possibility
of being replaced by AI, also disagreed with compensations stating: "... its our responsibility to find ways to be useful
with advancements of technology ..." adding that market conditions will cchange,and people need to adapt. Another
respondent had a rather blunt take about the validity of impacted jobs: "If the job can be easily replaced by a few
algorithms, then did the job really need to exist? Sounds like a people cribbing about calculators stealing jobs". However,
the vast majority of respondents (45% or 𝑛𝐼𝐷𝐾 = 18) reported that they "don’t know". Of these 18, 10 had provided
reasons to back up their choices. These choices can be placed into 3 groups10:
(1) Borderline Yes: The singular response in this category indicates that though the respondent is in favor of
compensations, they are unsure of how it would work.
"Carbon offsetting doesn’t really work well, and I think here you also bring in the issue of proving you
need to have lost livelihood, which is tricky. But we should not make it impossible for people to do certain
professions that they could have done otherwise."
(2) Borderline No:, As opposed to the previous item, the responses from this group, indicate that the respondents
might not be in favor of compensation. While one respondent in this category reported that Creative AI systems
are currently incapable of replacing [a significant] number of people and thus there is no need to think of
such compensations, all 4 other respondents state that changing market conditions are a fact of technological
advancement and AI is simply the next advancement.
"I’m not sure how other people who get laid off due to similar circumstances would feel about only one
genre of laid-off employees being compensated and why others are not".
10The group counts are: 𝑛𝐵𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑌 𝑒𝑠 = 1, 𝑛𝐵𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑁𝑜 = 5, 𝑛𝐽𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑑𝑜𝑛′𝑡𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤 = 4
13

(3) Just don’t know: The remaining 4 respondents stated the complex nature of this problem and their lack of
understanding as the reasons for choosing this option, or in other words, they really "don’t know".
"I am not really sure of how it should work really. Ai has a lot of potential to do tasks specifically those that
involve a linear and repetitive nature (ex accounting, reading documents). It is justified by the employer as
it saves team sizes and costs. While an entire field of work getting obsolete for people working in it is also
not seems right."
Overall, there appears to be mostly negative outlook by consumers on livelihoods lost by AI, though there does not
appear to be any conclusive evidence as to why.
4.1.5
Factual Transparency And Personal Connection To Media Stated As Primary Reasons For Requiring
The Provision Of AI-Information. Question 6 asked respondents which specific content they would like to be informed
about the use of Creative AI about; In combination with Q1 and Q2, we can get some interesting insights into future
labeling.
Among the largest count were sources of information, viz. Scientific literature (𝑛𝑠𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝐿𝑖𝑡 = 27) and News
articles (𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑠𝐴𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒𝑠 = 23). It could also be argued that YouTube Videos might also qualify as sources of information
for a lot of people and hence also might explain why it ranks the 2nd highest (𝑛𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑢𝑏𝑒 = 24); this contrasts with
less consequential items of Review Articles (𝑛𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤𝐴𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒𝑠 = 21) and Blog Posts (𝑛𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑃 𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑠 = 19) as sources of
information. With the exception of Blog Posts, Comics, Physical Art Pieces, Software Products, and Video Games,
for every other media category at least 50% of all respondents agreed that information on Creative AI use should be
required (ref. table 9 and figure 6 in Appendix C.4). Interestingly video games scored the lowest with only 9 respondents
suggesting that video games be labeled with Creative AI use information, though the reason for this is not clear. The
subjective data (10 of the 15 participants that reported) to these questions reveals that there are two main reasons why
respondents would like to see labels:
(1) Transparency of factual reporting/sources: The primary reason (reflected by both the count and subjective
answers to Q6, and the workshop discussions) was to evaluate the credibility and potential biases of the content
that they are reading. In addition, it appears that consumers are uncomfortable with the potential capabilities
and power of AI.
"For anything non-fiction (news article, youtube, or scientific paper) it would be useful to know if video
footage or photographs are real or not. For art/entertainment I don’t care if its AI generated."
(2) Personal connections: The remaining 5 respondents stated some personal reason or connection with the media
as a reason to be informed of the use of Creative AI.
"As a graphic designer each one of these things either i use directly in my work, or would be interesting
enough to use myself for future opportunity..."
These patterns were also seen during the workshop discussion where participants stated that they would not be
comfortable with Creative AI used in sensitive areas of writing such as (in this case) media coverage of the war in
Ukraine (ref. 4.2.1).
4.1.6
Labeling. When it came to what kinds of labeling consumers would like to see, a significant number of
respondents indicated that the type of label did not matter as long as a declaration was made (𝑛𝑝ℎ𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 = 13, (32.5%)
and 𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 15, (35%)). On the flip side, a very small minority of respondents reported to not care about such
labels (𝑛𝐼𝐷𝐶(𝑝ℎ𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙) = 9, (22.5%) and 𝑛𝐼𝐷𝐶(𝑑𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙) = 4, (10%)).
However, looking at the qualitative explanations, we can see that the reasons behind the respondents’ choices differed
(overall) between physical and digital media. 21 respondents provided qualitative explanations for their choices for
14
Investigating Consumer Perception and Speculative AI Labels for Creative AI Usage In Media
physical media, while 16 provided qualitative explanations for their choices for digital media. Of these 19 responses
provide usable data for physical media, and 12 for digital media. Each of these responses can be grouped into categories
(discussed below). Figure 6 and table 9 in Appendix C.4 provide the counts for each of the choices. While there were no
discernible patterns between responses and choices made, taking a look at table 8 in Appendix C.4 it can be seen that
while "AI Free" was the lowest picked labeling copy in both media types, when the option of "100% Human Creation"
was provided. This could indicate that consumers value the "human spirit" higher than the lack of AI (evidenced by the
discussion below under "The Human Aspect").
Reasons Respondents Wanted To See Labels On Physical Media. Participants responses can be grouped into 4 major
reasons for wanting to see physical media labeled with AI-related declarations: Monetary Factors, Curiosity, The
Human Aspect, and Consumer Choice. A majority of responses (7 of 19), indicated curiosity where respondents
were more interested in finding out how the media was produced, what tools contributed to their making, or just a
general interest in AI.
"I’m interested in AI, and seeing such labels would possibly make me more interested in product."
4 of the 19 responses indicated that labeling was important as they would like to understand what happens to the human
being replaced by AI. Their responses were thus either empathetic towards human workers and/or negatively directed
towards corporations.
"It is important that people use their brains & hand to eye coordination skills. It is also important we
have ethics around the use of AI. People are becoming more greedy & less empathetic, the over use of AI
does not help this, People need jobs."
3 out of 19 responses indicated that they would like labels to be provided as it would enable transparency and empower
their decision-making as consumers while purchasing physical media.
"Creates a sense of trust and transparency about what I am being offered".
Though only a singular respondent provided money as a factor for their choice, it is interesting to see that consumers
might base their spending choices on whether a product was made by AI or a human being. This finding could perhaps
be related to the handmade effect discussed in 4.2.3.
"If its AI made then I would expect it to be a bit cheaper".
Reasons Respondents Wanted To See Labels On Digital Media. Participants responses can be grouped into 3 major
reasons for wanting to see digital media labeled with AI-related declarations: Curiosity, The Human Aspect, and
Trustworthiness. Similar to physical media above, curiosity was the most provided reason (5 of 12) with similar
reasons of knowledge and interest.
"Interesting to see how much AI been used in digital content".
While The Human Aspect is a category just as with physical media, the reasons, however, differ. With physical media
the reasons were more empathetic towards the conditions of human workers, in digital media the responses indicated
empathy towards the work (media) instead, viz. towards the soul of the creation. A similar reason was heard during the
workshop discussions discussed in 4.2.3.
"Depends on the content being consumed but imo, in most cases the involvement of a human imparts
certain value to the final content through their experiences and stuff... which is not necessarily true for ai
stuff which can only try and emulate it. The additional context of who the creator is, holds value to me."
"I want to know if content is original human thought or a compilation of data that may have questionable
sources".

Aswath Sivakumaran
Reasons Respondents Did Not Care About Such Labels. It is also of interest to look at the reasons provided by
respondents (1 for digital, 4 for physical) for why they did not care about such labels. One respondent said that
they were against "any kind of mandatory labeling system" for both digital and physical media. They stated that:
"Existing certifications like UL and FCC already pose a large financial barrier for small companies and independent
developers...Adding additional mandators certifications only makes that problem worse."; However, the same respondent
was "in favor of regulations that define what labels like AI-Free and AI-Produced actually mean so that the labels can
be useful to consumers if the manufacturer chooses to put them on a product." Taken at face value then, this statement
can be interpreted as the respondent in favor of labeling from a consumer choice point of view, but not a regulations
point of view, viz. optional labeling.
While no other reasons were provided against labeling of digital media, physical media had 3 more distinct comments
(rather than reasons). One respondent reported that they "...don’t really care who created the physical product." "As
long as it is not a product whose manufacturing requires quality checks/regulation (medicines, building materials,
etc)...". This response is interesting as the respondent seems to be thinking about Creative AI used in more futuristic
contexts such as medicine (though however, it is also possible that they have considered Creative AI and AI more
generally as the same). Another respondent commented that though they were unsure about how to feel about AI they
felt that "...it would be nice if it is disclosed when ai is being used...due to their potential". While these two respondents
appear to be at least a little bit open to accepting the usefulness of labeling, one respondent outright stated that they
"do not think it is that important as this era is extremely digital" indicating that some consumers might just see AI as
an expansion of technological progress.
4.2
Results From N-Speculation Workshop Discussions
Two workshop sessions were conducted, one with 3 participants and another with 4. Participant11 demographics are
provided in table 2. A reflexive thematic analysis was carried out and the resulting codes and themes generated are
provided in table 3. The workshop consisted of two parts: (1) A discussion phase where participants discussed their
thoughts and feelings surrounding speculative prompts which investigated various aspects of the use of Creative AI in
consumer media; (2) A co-speculation activity where participants designed labels that would inform future consumers
on media that have used Creative AI in their production. The first phase of the workshop which focused on feelings
and perception featured three key takeaways: (1) consumers are willing to buy AI created works of art if the price and
quality match their perceptions of how much effort went into the work created, for example, a printed painting mimicing
watercolor will be percieved at lesser cost than a large canvas oil painting (ref. 4.2.1 and 4.2.2); (2) consumers are
heavily biased against AI, for example, they will pay less for a painting created by an AI compared to a similar work by
a human as they prefer the former to be of lower effort (𝑃5: "If the content is good, I’ll still accept it. But I wouldn’t pay
as much as I would for something [made by AI]."), or perciving AI produced works as inferior (𝐷𝑃2: "I would pay less
than the other parts of that series." on book written by a human vs an AI), though the origin of this bias is unknown
(ref. table 3); and (3) consumers are still trying to figure out where they stand on this situation and are grappling with
the ethics, morality, and power of AI, such as for example not knowing if they would accept AI replacing writers of
journalistic publications, or more broadly if AI creating media would align with their morals and what those morals
even are (ref. 4.2.4). The second phase which focused on speculative label design also provided 3 key takeaways: (1)
Consumers want to see AI usage Information for the media they consume (ref. 4.3.2), (2) participants preferred labels
that contained more information as opposed to simpler/minimal labels, (3) Consumers are influenced by existing labels

Table 3: Themes and codes from thematic analysis on Workshop discussions
4.2.1
Consumers Claim To Not Care But Show Bias Towards AI. All participants expressed, in various manners,
the same sentiment, i.e., they do not care if what they are consuming was created by an AI or a Human, as long as it has
good content and/or is worth the price being paid for it (this has been discussed in details in section 4.2.2). However,
during the discussions, it was also observed that participants are in various stages of assessment over the implications
of using AI to create art and how they would react to it. 𝑃4 stated that they would not make a decision on this subject
without thinking about it, and after a week of deliberation was OK with consuming works that were created by AI,
stating further that unless they were looking for works by a specific person, they would not care if it was created by an
AI. 𝑃1 and 𝑃2 shared that they would buy various works created by AI, though 𝑃1 suggested that the contributions (in
this specific case of a deceased author) should go to the author’s estate (a sentiment agreed by 𝑃7 though they had a
stronger response), while 𝑃2 stated: "I seem to not care about the legal aspect because I do not know how to attribute
creative stuff....I do not understand the model...". Stronger responses in a similar sentiment included those from 𝑃7: "I
probably wouldn’t care too much...", 𝑃3 : "If I like something I don’t care whether it’s done by artist or it’s done by AI."
However, despite this "don’t care" attitude, participants were very much grappling with the reality of the situation that
AI is disrupting activities that could once solely be attributed as an innate human quality. 𝑃5 stated: "I would buy it. If
it’s not a real person.", a sentiment that was echoed in a significant amount of responses, stating that the fact that AI
could just create human faces and likenesses out of thin air did not sit right with them, although they responded with
"... not creepy..." when asked if such behavior creeped them out, which indicates that the participant is still thinking
about this aspect but cannot nail down what they find unsettling. The same participant, though certain that they would
not have a problem buying a painting during 𝐷𝑃1, said "Now I have a problem!" the moment the floor to discuss 𝐷𝑃2
was opened. 𝑃1 was still trying to process and thinking for an answer out loud stating: "... I haven’t really ... wrapped
my mind.... Would I OK with it or not?" while discussing 𝐷𝑃3, thinking specifically from the angle of their profession
(journalist) and something personal to them (viz. a hypothetical reporting of the war in Ukraine where AI was used to
17
Aswath Sivakumaran
write the articles). These responses indicate that participants are still grappling with the ethical and moral aspects of
the use of Creative AI, possibly with a large portion of their dilemmas sprouting from their sentiments, biases, beliefs,
and the like. The results from this section show that what consumers say and what they do (including in the real world
with real stakes) are different and might be contradictory and circumstantial. Hence these behaviors and attitudes must
be studied in detail in the real world if there is an aim to understand customer (or more broadly societal) behavior and
attitudes and how it might affect the markets, industries, and businesses that use or implement Creative AI.
4.2.2
Quality Of The Content And Money Together Power Consumer Decision Making. All participants
across various discussion points indicated that they would purchase/pay for media works if the quality of the content or
its monetary worth makes sense to them. When participants discussed the monetary aspects, their responses came from
a personal sense of their attitudes towards purchase behavior in general. For example, 𝑃1 and 𝑃4 talked about how
they could relate to the ’broke student’ trope, with 𝑃1 stating that they would buy something that is "really nice" and
"affordable", and 𝑃1 saying "... I will probably buy it if I like it." during 𝐷𝑃1. Similarly, 𝑃2 said "...since it says it’s
considerably low. I would consider buying it." 𝑃3 said they would buy a painting if it was "very cheap and affordable"
during the discussion prompt. 𝑃7 stated "If it’s good looking and I feel like it’s going to really look good in my bedroom,
I have to put it. I am not going to care if it’s generated by AI or if it’s from a very famous artist.", seemingly the only
statement to equate the quality of AI art and human-made art. Participants also suggested that if using AI could bring
down the prices of the works, such as lowering the price of a painting or a lower subscription cost, participants would
very much be in favor for the use of AI in creating media works. For example, while discussing 𝐷𝑃4, 𝑃5 stated that
if the show was just mediocre it would make no difference to him if AI was used or even if it replaced some human
creatives and further saw it as a cost-saving measure that the studio could implement to continue production, as opposed
to if the show was an "acclaimed series before it [AI] was introduced". A further bias towards the content can be
seen by the fact that all participants wanted to purchase the final AI-assisted book in 𝐷𝑃2, with 𝑃7 saying "Since you
mentioned Harry Potter, I’m still gonna go for it" saying that if they are a fan and would have to wait for the next Harry
Potter book then they wouldn’t even think about it, a statement that is consistent with what they said about purchasing
an AI created painting mentioned previously. Similarly, 𝑃6 said "If you are truly a fan of some series you never even
[think] whether it’s been written by someone or some robot or something." It is interesting to note that though the
medium changed from paintings to books to YouTube videos, this behavior towards money and content quality did
not change. For example, while discussing 𝐷𝑃5, 𝑃6 said they would continue watching AI-produced videos and that
it "doesn’t matter." Similarly, 𝑃7 stated that as long as it was still the same quality and worth their time, they would
continue watching those videos, the purpose of those videos was "entertainment" and if that purpose was fulfilled
"I’m not gonna dig into too many details". 𝑃2 also agreed with the consensus and would continue watching the videos,
going further and adding that the use of AI is still ultimately based on the creator’s creativity. However, this content
bias also includes a bias towards AI. For example, 𝑃3 said "I think I want to know what’s going to happen.... if there is
some climax going to be there I don’t mind AI writing it...", however following it up with "If I read the book first and
like it then I will leave it ... But if it’s not nice then I’ll be blaming that book", agreeing with 𝑃5 who stated: "If it’s not
good then you’re like, yeah, it’s all because of AI."
4.2.3
The Human Touch. Throughout the discussions, it was apparent that participants valued AI-created works
as inferior to human-created works. This was very apparent during the discussions of 𝐷𝑃1 and 𝐷𝑃2. 𝑃4 said "...
randomly looking for something to decorate, yeah you can buy it." referring to the fact that unless you are looking for
something special, the creator of the art does not make a difference. 𝑃5 contrasted humans and AI creating artworks by
stating that in the case of AI "... it’s not a skill." because the AI is "basing it on already people who have done it." The
inferiority factor continues into purchase behavior where participants remarked that they would pay less for work that
18
Investigating Consumer Perception and Speculative AI Labels for Creative AI Usage In Media
has been created by AI. 𝑃5 stated: "If the content is good, I’ll still accept it. But I wouldn’t pay as much as I would for
something [made by AI]." during 𝐷𝑃2. Similarly, 𝑃7 remarked that they agreed that there are some costs and human
labor involved in generating and perhaps making prints but wouldn’t pay too much money for something they could
do at home, in reference to AI-generated artworks during 𝐷𝑃1. During the same discussion, 𝑃2 remarked that they
would not pay a lot [for the AI paintings] and would consider buying "since it’s considerably low". 𝑃2 also held onto
this purchase behavior during 𝐷𝑃2 stating "I would pay less than the other parts of that series." when referring to
purchasing the final book written by an AI, even though it was 70% and not the whole book. 𝑃4 also stated that "I
prefer not to know it before reading the book..." since they felt that they would judge it more negatively if the content
was written by an AI and did not meet their expectations. This discussion also gives rise to the understanding that
consumers perceive AI-created works as inferior to human-created art. This kind of inferiority of AI art (or superiority
of human creations) could be attributed to the handmade effect [33] and consumers could perceive human-made
creations of higher quality, taking more time, and would be willing to pay more. However, another factor that attributes
to this kind of perception could also be due to the "human" creators themselves. During the discussion of 𝐷𝑃2, 𝑃5
stated that the series was based on the reputation of the author and "... what the author initially did..." and if an AI were
to take over the work of the author "... it doesn’t give that entire feel [and] connection to the artist." 𝑃1 stated "... if I
was a millionaire and the price wasn’t an issue, pretty sure I would go for fine art ... and that would be a painting by an
artist with a history." 𝑃7 said of AI completed works "... there no human aspect in that, so they [the fans] will have that
emotion and sentiment." when talking about Schubert’s AI completed symphony [72].
4.2.4
Discomfort From AI’s Power And Capabilities. From the discussions, it was also evident that participants
were uncomfortable with the power and capabilities of AI. Throughout the workshop, 𝑃5 was constantly emphasizing
how they were put off by (and did not want) AI creating human figures, further stating multiple times that they wanted
to be informed by "... some disclaimer saying this is created by AI", a request shared by 𝑃2 in a different session stating
"... there should be some kind of attribution..." when asked if they considered use of AI to produce art as stealing or
inspiration. 𝑃5 also stated, while discussing 𝐷𝑃4, that they were not comfortable with AI-created biases which could
"... sway populations with AI, if it’s not regulated..." and that if articles created were not neutral "It can go way out
of control."; following which 𝑃4 agreed saying "... as long as it is informative, then I can trust AI." recalling using
ChatGPT had only been trained with information up to a certain year and some information was thus misleading. 𝑃4
also stated that it would be nice if "They clearly show the database that the AI has been trained on so in that way you can
kind of get closer to this. Maybe it’s the database itself that is biased?" 𝑃5 also compared the pre and post-eras of Elon
Musk’s Twitter acquisition [22] to the behavior of AI in the context of censoring certain views based on what a group
of people determines, and said "But if you completely take away that option of agreeing or disagreeing from the people,
then you’re getting into the territory of imposing structures where you cannot see information beyond this point.",
suggesting that though humans are all biased, if AI enforces such biases, it would obfuscate opposing information and
provide preference to select narratives over others. 𝑃1 while not directly stating their discomfort had stated "Right now
I would not like to read an article written by an AI..." for sensitive subjects such as the war in Ukraine.
4.3
Co-Speculative Label Design
The second stage of the workshop saw participants create speculative future labels to distinguish AI-generated content.
Scanned worksheets can be found in Appendix D.2. Below are the findings after performing content analysis on the
combined data of the worksheet and participant statements during the discussions of co-speculation.
4.3.1
Target Groups For AI Labels. All participants stated their labels were targeted at consumers, while some
participants included additional target audiences such as artists (𝑃3, 𝑃5 and 𝑃6), stores (𝑃6), industries (𝑃3), or anyone
19

providing media content or services (𝑃5). 4 of 7 participants stated their labels intended to provide information to
consumers on AI use; an additional 𝑃5 stated that their label was intended for "software creation attribution". 𝑃1 did
not provide any data, and data provided by 𝑃3 was extremely vague and thus unusable. It is interesting to see that,
although artists and software developers are consumers, these ’creators’ are those whose professions are directly being
affected by Creative AI. Perhaps this could imply that consumers might be empathetic towards them unconsciously
(in opposition to what was stated by both the survey respondents and the workshop participants). Targeting labels at
entities other than consumers or creators, though an interesting take by participants, does not fit the scope of this study;
However, it is interesting for the broader research in label design to study how labels might be targeted towards, for
example, industries and stores, and what implications they might bring.
4.3.2
Analysis of Key Design Elements in Speculative Labels. Analyzing the labels designed by participants we
can understand the three parts of the labels that participants thought were important: Pictograms, ’AI Usage Amount’,
and Colors. Additionally, the ’layouts’ of these labels were also analyzed, though they were not discussed by the
participants themselves. These four particulars are described below in the order that they were deemed important from
participant drawings and statements.
Usage of Pictograms. All 7 participants used some kind(s) graphical elements (such as pictograms and icons) in
their label designs (ref. fig. 3). Five used some kind of robot drawing to symbolize AI, while 𝑃5 used a spanner and
gear to symbolize AI. On the other hand, only 3 of the 6 labels used some pictographic representation for human
being. It could be understood then that consumers would more readily understand a label denoting Creative AI use if it
contained a pictogram of a robot or something similar to denote ’AI Use’. Graphical elements were also the largest
(by area) and most visually directed part of the entire label. 𝑃2 used the node similar to those used to describe neural
networks. The design from 𝑃3 was an outlier where the entire label was a singular pictogram, further indicating that
pictograms were considered to be the most important aspect of a label’s design to the participants.
AI Usage Amount Information (AIuAI). 6 out of 7 participants indicated AI Usage Amount on their label designs.
This term includes both numerical values (such as percentage of product created by AI), and blanket terms such as
"AI-assisted", "Fully AI Produced", etc. Participants chose different manners in which to convey these terms; two
20
Investigating Consumer Perception and Speculative AI Labels for Creative AI Usage In Media
participants used only graphical elements to convey this information, while the remaining 4 participants used both
graphical elements and texts (with 𝑃5 using color as well). All 6 participants also indicated that their scale of AI
usage would range from "No AI Used" (or similar text) to "100% AI Produced" or (similar text). Except for 𝑃5, no
participants designed labels that had "Human Created" or similar text, though multiple participants included labels that
contained human figures. 3 out of the 6 participants included percentage rating and letter grade ratings to signify how
much AI was used, with one other participant using only percentage and no letter grade. The remaining participants
who did not include any text chose three forms of labels: Fully AI produced, AI Assisted, and No AI Used. While they
chose the same 3 forms of labeling, they used different words to indicate what their labels meant. 𝑃1 used the phrases
"Entirely Man Made", "AI + Man Made", and "Entirely Made By AI"; 𝑃2 used the phrases "No conscious help from
LLM", "AI Assisted", and "Fully AI Created".
Color. Though color was not provided in the reference labels, some participants attempted to include color in their
designs. 𝑃5 and 𝑃7 used gradation-based color12 labels to depict the amount of AI used in their label designs, similar
to the use of color in the EU energy label13. 𝑃5 used colors to provide a visual indication on how much of the product
used AI. The design utilized a green-to-red gradient, where (generally) green is highest good and red is highest bad
[71], though interestingly 𝑃5 used green to represent 100% AI use, possibly indicating that they saw AI use as a net
positive.
Label Layout And Structure. As stated before, the graphical element was the centerpiece of all 7 label designs
taking up the most space. 4 of 7 participants placed their label elements inside rectangular boxes. 2 of the 4 had
placed the label at the top of their designs, while the other 2 had placed them in the center. AIuAI headings (such as
percentage and/or grades) were the second largest aspects of the labels, though their placements about the graphical
elements varied greatly. There were also two particularly interesting layouts: 𝑃6 included information on the types of
AI tools/technologies used and audience information in the border, and 𝑃4 included a version of the label that could
be used in digital environments where the label could display more information when expanded. Hence future label
designs should include large and easy-to-understand pictograms with AIuAI information as the most prominent parts
of their label designs, while also looking into the areas of application.
4.4
Changes In Perception
Prior to the start of the workshop, participants were made to fill out a nine-item questionnaire that corresponded to their
attitudes and perceptions on topics surrounding Creative AI. An identical questionnaire was provided to the participants
at the end of the workshop to evaluate if their attitudes and perceptions changed after learning new information. Overall,
there is an average improvement of 0.06 points (or 1.95%) positively towards Creative AI. Looking at the individual
per-question scores, however, we can see that a majority of attitudes remain unchanged. Table 4 below shows how the
averages for each question changed between the pre and post workshop sessions. Tables 8 and 12 in appendix D.3
contain the question codes and full overview of the answers changed at a participant level.
12The drawings are still in black and white as no color drawing materials were provided to participants.

Table 4: Comparison table of question averages pre and post workshop
Question A asked if consumer choice labels affected their purchase decisions in the past and increased by 0.43 points
(16.73%). There doesn’t appear to be a concrete reason for this, but perhaps might be due to participants realizing
that labels did unconsciously affect their decisions. Question B evaluated if consumers would like to be informed
of Creative AI use for media they pay for and remained unchanged with a score of 3.57 indicating moderately high
importance. Question C evaluated consumer spending habits around content that is fully produced by Creative AI and
remained unchanged with a score of 2.57 indicating that on average consumers would pay less for content produced
in such a way. Question D evaluated consumer spending habits around content that is partially produced/assisted by
Creative AI reduced by 0.14 points (or 5.17%) indicating that consumers would now more decisively pay less for
’AI-assisted’ media. Question E evaluated if consumers thought they would see Creative AI used more in the media
they consume, remained unchanged with a score of 3.86 indicating that a majority of consumers are cautiously positive
about this trend. Question F evaluated if consumers saw Creative AI as a threat to human creativity, and decreased by
0.14 points (or 5.44%) indicating that fewer participants saw AI as a threat to human creativity with only somewhat
average agreement. Question G evaluated if consumers saw Creative AI as a threat to creative professions/professionals,
and also remained unchanged with an average score of 3.29 indicating that consumers are mostly unsure. Question H
evaluated if consumers saw some creative jobs being at least majorly replaced by Creative AI, and remained unchanged
with a score of 3.43 indicating that most consumers believed (to a fair degree) this to be true. Question I asked
participants if they would be okay with some creative jobs being replaced by Creative AI, and increased by 0.43 points
(or 13.69%) indicating that more participants agreed that they would be fine with more creative jobs going away.
Since the reasons for these questions were not directly requested, it is unknown why the specific responses to questions
changed. However, it can be understood from the workshop discussions that overall participants are (1) unsure of where
they stand concerning the ethical and moral quandaries of Creative AI, and (2) are open to changing their opinions
when they learn more.
4.5
Recommendations For Consumer Labeling Based On Workshop Insights
From the initial discussions phase of the workshop, it can be seen that consumers are willing to spend money on
AI-created media, though there exists a dichotomy of bias against AI and AI-created works; another way to phrase this
dichotomy would be ’indecision’. Consumers are indecisive and still attempting to understand where they stand on the
whole issue of AI (Creative or otherwise) and the effect it has on people (ref. 4.2.1). How consumers react in the long
term once media using Creative AI becomes far more mainstream than it is right now to be seen, though from the
results of the workshop it is apparent that providing consumers with information related to AI usage can enable them
to make better and more informed decisions. The label designs have indicated that for the most part, consumers would
like to see AI Usage Information. The reason for this ranges from simple reasons such as curiosity or consumer choice
empowerment to more sensitive reasons such as personal connection to the media/content/material (such as AI writing
news articles about war), fear of AI’s power and misinformation, and preventing AI from influencing their biases and
22
Investigating Consumer Perception and Speculative AI Labels for Creative AI Usage In Media
world views. The workshop suggests that this information be presented as either quantitative (percentage or grades) or
qualitative (Human Produced, AI Produced, etc.) measures. These measures can be depicted or aided by pictographic
elements, primarily that of robots or other such pictograms that depict AI, and perhaps also using figures that depict
people. These pictograms (or similar graphical elements) are the centerpieces of the label designs and the most visually
prominent part of the designs. Apart from this, color might also be an important aspect of future label designs, though
the workshops only yielded preliminary evidence of this. Comparing the labels with each other, we can see by the
voting dots that participants preferred more informative labels, viz. labels that provided more information about AI
usage. Participants also seemed to prefer labels that had well-represented pictograms where it was obvious to know
who the creator was (AI, Human, or collaboration) by looking at the label. The label designs designed by participants
also bear some resemblances or are inspired by certain pre-existing labels (such as the EU energy label discussed
previously), which means that more familiar label designs can be studied not just to design the labels themselves but,
for example, localize the labels to different markets, medium (physical or digital), or media type. Though these results
have provided vital information on the recommended routes to take while designing such AI labels for consumers,
these results must be studied or worked upon further due to certain drawbacks and limitations discussed in the next
section.
4.6
Meta Analysis of N-Speculation Workshop
To provide a complete picture of the results above it is important to also address the possible drawbacks and biases
that might have affected the study results. First, all the workshop participants were pursuing higher education at a
technical university and would thus have more insights about Creative AI than the average consumer, possibly resulting
in volunteer bias. However, the fact that the results from the survey, which saw respondents from all over the world
and from various educational backgrounds, still concurred with some of the workshop results provides validity to the
workshop results. When it came to label designs, pre-existing labels might have caused participants to unconsciously
draw inspiration from or mimic existing designs. Further, since some examples of AI labels (ref. fig. 9 in Appendix
D.4) were shown, this could have caused participants to narrow their thinking and be influenced on what these label
designs should look like. Further, the 15-minute time limit on designing the labels might have caused participants to
depend on the existing label designs shown. Additionally, these pre-conceived examples in combination with the fact
that participants had to design labels could have caused framing bias where labeling might have been presented in a
favorable light; while the survey does provide major confirmation of the validity of this data, the option to dismiss
labels as anything necessary was simply not provided during the workshop and, as can be seen by the survey, was
an option that was chosen by not an insignificant number of respondents. However, seeing the usage of color and
variations of other kinds of graphical elements in label designs that highly differ from those presented means that
though participants might have been influenced by the designs presented, they were not heavily biased to creating
designs that copied those presented. Apart from bias, it can also be seen that the scope of these label designs was
limited due to the constraints of time and limited variables being studied during the study. For example, two participants
indicated their intentions to use color in their label designs; it is thus possible that this number could have been higher
given (1) more time, and (2) coloring tools (colored pencils, crayons, etc.) to implement color in their designs. This
could affect how label designs using or not using color could be perceived and how the factors discussed above could
have their order of importance rearranged. The scope of these labels is also limited to the medium (paper) that was
used during the workshop; perhaps holographic labels, labels with texture, or even video labels might have greater or
lesser effects on consumers in physical or digital spaces. There are plenty of possible factors that could enhance these
AI labels, however, it is in the nature of studies to be delimited and provide directions for future research work to be
carried out (vide 5.5).

DISCUSSION
The results of this study provide preliminary insights into the perceptions and attitudes of consumers surrounding the
use of Creative AI in media, and positively studied a viable solution to the problems related to consumer choice that
will arise. Through the content analysis of 32 Creative AI tools, it was discovered that Creative AI, though capable, is
not a replacement for human professionals anytime soon, though some jobs/tasks will be replaced. The survey helped
assess the various attitudes and perceptions of consumers on various aspects relating to the use of Creative AI in
media. The survey showed that less than half of consumers wanted to see any kind of compensation for the loss of
livelihoods due to Creative AI though interestingly 45% of respondents either did not know enough to be definitive or
did not want to admit what they really thought. The survey also showed that consumers care about the state of the
information they receive and are aware of the impact that Creative AI could have on factual accuracy and reporting.
Finally, the survey showed positive preliminary evidence of the need for labeling AI use in consumer media. The
N-Speculative Workshop expanded on the results of the survey and provided insights into the design for future AI
labels. The N-Speculative workshop showed that though consumers claim to not care about AI-created works they also
have underlying biases towards AI. Further, it also showed that consumers do not completely trust AI, especially with
content that is personal to them or content that requires high factual accuracy. Similar to what was seen in the survey,
the N-Speculative workshop also showed that consumers are aware of and concerned with the power that AI possesses
when used in media. The N-Speculative workshop also brought up new revelations; consumers would highly take into
consideration the price, quality, and creator (Human or AI) to evaluate if and how much they would pay for certain
work, valuing AI work as inferior to human work. The N-Speculative workshop also provided preliminary insights
into the design of AI labels. Prominent pictograms and detailed AI usage information topped the list of requirements
for consumers. It was also interesting to see that consumers are influenced by other pre-existing labels (ex. 𝑃5 and
𝑃7 drew inspiration from the EU energy label) and future label designs should take those into account. Finally, the
N-Speculative workshop also showed that there is a need to empower consumers with more information for them to
make more informed choices in the era of Creative AI.
5.1
Advancements In Creative AI Is Dependent On Educating The Consumer
Looking at sections 4.2.4 and the responses in the Survey Results (4.1) we can see that people have a variety of
different understandings of the way AI works or will affect them. Such confusion also creates hindrances to the
implementation and acceptance of AI in mainstream creative uses. Further, once AI-created works become mainstream,
they may reorganize the consumer purchase market, where AI-created works might take over the ’fast-markets’, while
human-produced works would take up the higher-end or luxury markets; analogous to the consumer perception of
mass-produced fast fashion such as H&M or Zara and luxury brands such as Armani or Gucci that pride themselves on
their handmade craftmanship [66, 90]. We must venture into a reality where AI-created media becomes a significant
role in our lives along with consumers. It is thus important for a variety of reasons that there be a dissemination of
information related to Creative AI in the hopes of alleviating some of the concerns that scare consumers.
5.2
The Future Of AI Labeling
Prior to commencing the study, it was unknown if consumers would be positive towards AI labels. However, given
the undecided or mid-point responses from both the survey respondents as well as the "still thinking" nature of the
workshop participants, we can see that labels might help give them more information about their purchases or where
and how they spend their money. It is currently not possible to predict if in the future there will be a requirement for AI
labeling without any large-scale and long-term studies into consumer behavior surrounding Creative AI and its uses.
24
Investigating Consumer Perception and Speculative AI Labels for Creative AI Usage In Media
However, these studies will also have to wait until Creative AI becomes more mainstream in media. Thus, this thesis,
presents a preliminary window into a mansion of studies that is Creative AI and consumerism, and more specifically
into AI labels. The current results of this study indicate that consumers are still unsure about Creative AI (mostly) due
to the information gap that exists between consumer perception and reality, which leads to bias, uncertainty, and fear.
However, the study results also indicate that with education on Creative AI, a change in such perception and attitudes
including purchase behaviors is positively witnessed. Further, the results of the N-Speculative workshop present AI
labels as a solution in a favorable light and provide indications of the potential characteristics that these future AI
labels should have to be effective.
5.3
Ethical Discussions Surrounding Of Creative AI And Consumer Choice
There has been quite a lot of discussion surrounding the ethics of using Creative AI. These questions have not only been
reserved for philosophers or academics but also the laypeople (consumers) who, though lacking any specializations in
these areas, are pondering these moral and ethical quandaries. While nobody has the definite answers to these questions
yet, it is important to have discussions of the ethics that surround Creative AI to ensure responsible implementation and
research, free from hasty decisions such as calling for a pause of AI development [63], replacing human works with AI
tools [84], or outright predicting the downfall of companies that embrace AI [75]. Hence this section surrounding the
ethics of the subject matter is centered around the following premise: "What are the ethicalities of allowing consumers
to steer the course of Creative AI technology, whether it be mainstream adoption, regulation, or its demise?"
5.3.1
AI Labels As A Counter To AI Bias. Bias in AI systems has been well documented and reported for a long
time; Google Photos labeled a black couple as gorillas [55], Meta’s Galactica started writing racist and inaccurate
scientific literature [28], and an image generator providing racist and sexist images [4] are just some of the recently
reported incidents of AI producing biased results. This concern of bias was also shared by the workshop participants
(ref. sec. 4.2) and the survey respondents (ref. sec. 4.1). AI labels might serve as a way to at least restrict the amount of
damage caused. For example, labeling sensitive content, such as coverage of war or ongoing societal protest, that has
been written by Creative AI and providing the warning of possible bias or information of the relevant weights used by
the model could be a solution of ensuring that consumers are well informed about any potential biases that may have
crept in, rather than being (or believing that they are) misled and blame Creative AI.
5.3.2
Consumer Perception Of Artistic Identity. Both the survey responses and the workshop discussions saw
consumers state that more than the work itself, the name of the artist/author held meaning to them. Before the explosion
of Creative AI, artistic creations were always tied to a human creator and the styles reflected in these works became
trademarks, or a way to recognize the artist from the art: This could be, for example, Wes Anderson’s use of symmetry,
Salvador Dalí’s surrealist painting style, Pablo Picasso’s Cubism, Andy Warhol’s Pop Art prints, or ad-libs found in
rap music. Since Creative AI generates works based on an amalgamation of its learnings, it does not have a distinct
style of its own. Thus, the question arises: Is it still art when the "artist" element of a work is stripped away? Does the
art now become superficial? People purchase paintings, go to concerts, or buy a creator’s merchandise because of the
name(s) that are attached to it; would consumers buy "A painting by Mid Journey", or watch a movie "Written and
Directed by RunwayML"? Further, if consumers no longer care about the identity of the artists, would it spell the same
fate for the artists as it did for carpenters and artisans who had their artistic identities and livelihoods diminished by
the first industrial revolution? How many names of famous artisans and carpenters do we know today as compared to
famous musicians and painters? These questions become more difficult when applied to forms of art (such as acting)
where the art and the artists ’cannot be separated’; How much of their likeness does a person own, is it only their face,
25
Aswath Sivakumaran
their whole body, their voice [81], or some combination of these? Do people lose copyrights to their likeness after their
death similar to other copyrighted works [83]?
5.3.3
Consumers And Deciding Ethics Around Use Of Creative AI. The results of this study clearly show that
consumers are still attempting to understand where their morals lie on the use of Creative AI, in media or otherwise.
However, is it ethical for consumers to be deciding the ethicality of Creative AI? What would happen if consumers
decided that all Creative AI is bad? Should technological evolution be halted simply because a large number of people
deem it to be unethical in manners that resemble those of the first industrial revolution? Is it ethical for businesses and
organizations to force consumers to accept Creative AI-produced work as the new status quo? Consumerism is a highly
social phenomenon and consumer perceptions might be affected by societal acceptances or common social attitudes.
For example, wide-scale adoption of smart glasses was impeded due to social factors such as rudely referring to the
wearers as "glassholes" [70]. The reverse can also be seen with, for example, the wide adoption of ChatGPT among
students [82]. Consumers’ perceptions can be significantly influenced by information that is readily available and easily
understood, such as social media, mainstream journalistic media, or social discussions. Hence it is not out of left field
to suggest that these perceptions or understandings might be flawed or biased in comparison to scientific literature,
though given that these sources are far more accessible to the everyday consumer, they are often the go-to sources of
information. This statement then loops back into the core ethical question of this paper: "What are the ethicalities of
allowing consumers to steer the course of Creative AI technology, whether it be mainstream adoption, regulation, or its
demise?" It must be made a priority for all stakeholders, academics, creators, businesses, and consumers, to approach
the subject of Creative AI with an open mind and educate themselves and others with unbiased and high-quality
information that, in an ideal world, the era of Creative AI shaped by clear thinking individuals and organizations
without crude and misguided regulations, rather than agenda driven corporations and interest groups or misinformed
consumers.
5.4
Reflections On Sustainability In The Creative AI Era
Creative AI is set to change the landscape of not just Creative work, but also our relationships with business, our
impact on the environment, livelihoods, inequality, education landscapes, and landmark legal decisions surrounding
our usage of technology, art, and copyright...to name a few. Most obvious among these, is that Creative AI provides a
lot of (mostly monetary) incentives: Compared to human workers, AI costs less [56], requires far shorter downtime as
AI does not need to sleep or rest, and is (on average) faster than humans; AI is also not governed by the same laws that
human workers are, such as maximum working hours or mandatory leaves, meaning that companies can use their AI
systems as they please without the ’hassles’ that come with human workers. Such advancements are very likely (cf.
sec. 1) and would start with mass unemployment in some professions, snowballing into greater implications on social
sustainability. Social sustainability can be defined as managing the positive and negative impacts of systems, processes,
organizations, and activities on people and society [9]. Extrapolating from the above situation of mass Creative AI
adoption, we can see that mass unemployment will eventually lead to some professions being "AItomated". This will
lead to mass protests, similar to those seen during the 2023 Hollywood writers [10] and actors [76] strikes, though the
outcome might not be similarly favorable. Such volatility of some careers will result in mass shifts to more in-demand
professions such as AI or ML, resulting in some academic streams seeing greater competition and importance, while
others such as creative arts or design will see a decline. Such shifts might also result in widening inequalities, as fields
of AI/ML are often white, and male dominated [17]. Such changing paradigms will affect people en-mass and might
see regulations being made to compensate for these ’human losses’, which might stifle advancements of Creative AI
especially if business bottom-lines are hit. Mass adoption of AI does not only affect social sustainability but also has
26
Investigating Consumer Perception and Speculative AI Labels for Creative AI Usage In Media
significant environmental impacts. One estimate suggests that simply the creation of GPT-3 is estimated to have emitted
as much carbon as a hundred gas cars in a year [68, 79]; AI, from training to active deployment and use, is very energy
intensive and will require the setting up of new green energy infrastructure (which will against have financial and
social impacts) to meet the energy demands sustainably.
5.5
Limitations And Future Work
Creative AI is a very broad field. Not only is the scope of research extremely wide, but the lack of a concrete definition
also means that there is going to be a large grey area for tools and technologies that sit on the fence of being classified
as Creative AI. For example, AI used to perform content-aware fill in Adobe Photoshop or After Effects could be
considered to be Creative AI, if the replacement and removal procedures are considered to be Creative. Further, the
new AI tools are rapidly being created and the capabilities of the old ones are also being expanded. For example, during
the time of this study, ChatGPT was expanded by using GPT-4 and even got plugin support. It is of course without
doubt that the expansion of this definition and taking another look at these Creative AI tools will lead to changes
in this study’s results, for example, by including Creative AI tools that do not have easily accessible versions. The
N-Speculation method, despite its advantages over traditional design speculation, also possesses certain drawbacks.
At its core, N-Speculation is still a type of speculative design approach and as a result, comes with some uncertainty
Further, N-Speculation aims to act as a bridge between traditional design research and speculative design research, the
consequence of this placement means that the results obtained are not as conclusive, however provides preliminary (or
even actionable) insights to inform future studies around the subject matter (unlike traditional speculative design). This
same lack of conclusiveness is also applied to workshops, where it can safely be predicted that there will be differences
in what people say (or do) during the workshop and what they end up doing in real life, such as for example, when
their own money is at stake. Further, the workshop consisted of only 7 participants who all have similar insights on the
subject matter based on their educational qualifications and future studies must expand on the number of participants
as well as the diversity of the study group.

CONCLUSION
This study has provided initial scientific insights into consumer perception of Creative AI use in media and has also
provided insights into the possible solution of AI labels to empower consumer choice in this new frontier. The results
from the content analysis show that Creative AI tools are highly capable of replacing certain professions entirely,
though the implementation of this in professional settings remains to be seen. The content analysis also tells us that
current Creative AI tools are highly capable in image, text, and code areas, while other areas such as music and video
continue to be developed and will only get better with time. The survey and workshop discussion results show a mostly
ambivalent consumer that is unlikely to stay away from or boycott media simply because they are ’made by Creative
AI’. However, the study also shows that consumers are curious and want information that allows them to make more
informed choices. Further, consumers are, like any other kind of spending, going to put money and quality above
most other factors. When it came to labeling the study discovered that consumers are also, for the most part, in favor
of labeling media that has used Creative AI. Further, the workshop also provided insights into the important design
elements of such labels: Pictograms/Graphical Elements, AI Usage Information, well-structured layouts of AIuAI and
pictogram(s), and possibly color. Given the prominence and unprecedented speed of development of Creative AI and
its impact on society, there a significant need to study consumer choice, bias, and misinformation, and be actively
involved in some way towards the synergetic development of Creative AI for societal good.

How does cost affect consumer
choice?
You want to buy decorations for your new house, so you go shop-
ping. You come across a painting that you think will look good on
your wall. You check the price tag and can’t believe how affordable
it is! It looks like a mistake! Paintings don’t cost this much?! You
check with the store employee. They inform you that the store sells
paintings generated by AI and that is how they can sell them for
such a low price and high quality.

𝐷𝑃2
Ethics, Fandom, and what do peo-
ple look for in art?
The 7th and final book of a series that you like has been released
after nearly a decade! You have been waiting so long for the
cliffhanger from the 6th book to resolve, so you immediately go
online and order it! After ordering you wonder why there has been
such a delay, so you look it up only to find that the author had
passed away after completing about 30% of the final installment
(book). Turns out an AI had been trained on her older works and
has completed the remaining 70% of her book.
𝐷𝑃3
Artist or Information
You like to stay on top of the latest information in your area of
interest (technology, fashion, gaming, entertainment, etc.). You
pull up an article on an online publication (a blog or type of non-
traditional news) website you frequent due to their high editorial
standards. However, you notice there is something off about the
article’s style and language. You check to see who the author is and
to your surprise instead of a name you find a label "AI Produced.
Click to learn more." You click and learn that to stay in business,
they have switched to using AI to write articles instead of humans.
𝐷𝑃4
What if nothing changed?
You enjoy binge-watching a soap opera (formulaic TV shows that
go on for years and may have daily episodes) on lazy days as a com-
fort show. It has a very predictable plot line, mediocre acting, and
a template-esque editing and screenplay structure across episodes.
During an episode you notice that the credits are much shorter than
usual, a trend which continues through all the following episodes.
You take a closer look to realize that no writer or editor are men-
tioned. You look it up to realize that the show is now fully written
and edited by AI, though you have never noticed this change while
watching an episode.
𝐷𝑃5
Art or Artist
A YouTube Content Creator that you have been following for years
has suddenly started uploading daily instead of weekly and the
content quality is still as high as you would expect from them. You
then find a video where the channel addresses that they will be
producing some videos using AI. This includes writing, editing,
and even the likeness of your YouTube creator! You can’t seem to
tell the difference between which is made by an AI, and which is
made by the creator themselves.

ENDNOTES
(1) The pronouns "they" and "their" are used as gender-neutral pronouns to refer to all participants/respondents in
the third person out of respect for their gender identities as these were never asked or clarified.
(2) Workshop participant quotes and paraphrasing can be distinguished by the use of ("xyz") or lack of (xyz)
quotation marks respectively.
(3) Quotes from workshop participants are provided after removing fillers such as "uh", "um", "like", or after
removing parts of the quote that may contain personal information. Further, the quotes have been edited to suit
the written format, as people speak differently from writing. This also accounts for participants who did not
speak English as a first language and had trouble communicating certain sentences. Overall, care has been taken
to ensure that the meanings of the statements are not altered.
(4) "War in Ukraine" refers to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine [1].
(5) Decimal values are truncated to the nearest 2 decimal places after rounding using the rule of rounding up if the
face value of the decimal place is equal to or greater than 5.
(6) The word "products" has been used in multiple places and still refers to artistic creations or other creative outputs,
and is used simply due to direct quotations or semantic reasons.
