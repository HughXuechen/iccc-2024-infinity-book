ABSTRACT 
Conversational agents have limited conversational capabilities and 
there is a debate as to whether interactions with conversational 
user interfaces (CUIs) are truly conversational. Currently, most 
news and journalistic content is presented in a monologic form. 
Simultaneously, there is an expectation that CUIs can change how 
we interact with news content. To explore what conversational 
interactions with the news could look like, two co-speculation 
workshops were arranged. The design-led inquiries focus on how 
conversations can be used as a resource for designing interactions 
with CUIs for news. Three diferent prototyping techniques were 
used in the design explorations: storyboarding, scripting and role-
playing. Our work ofers two main contributions: 1) We identify 
three dimensions relevant to the design space of CUI for news: the 
CUIs’ role, conversational capabilities, and locus of control, and 
2) a critical refection on the potential of diferent techniques for 
prototyping CUIs.

1 INTRODUCTION 
In science fction and commercial advertisements, conversational 
technologies are often portrayed as well-functioning artifcial intel-
ligence (AI) with human-like conversational capabilities that are 
seamlessly incorporated into everyday life. For written conversa-
tional user interfaces (CUIs), such portrayals are becoming more 
realistic with the emergence of generative AI applications, such 
as Chat-GPT, and the advancements of socialbots such as Replika,

where users’ report having human-AI friendship and companion-
ships [5, 51]. With regards to conversational agents, spoken CUIs, 
such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa, there are still limitations 
in conversational abilities [8, 28, 43, 46], and there is an ongoing 
debate as to whether such interfaces can be considered truly con-
versational [8, 45, 46]. 
With the around-the-clock access to news through diferent medi-
ums, news has become an integrated part of our “everyday routines 
and experiences” [33]. News serve to keep citizens informed about 
their world, and plays an important role of promoting talk, opin-
ions and discussions [16]. Journalism studies focus on the societal 
signifcance of news due to its role in empowering and steering 
civic and political discussions [33]. Still, most journalistic content is 
presented to the audience in a monologic form, including news de-
livered through conversational agents. Nordberg and Guribye [38] 
point to users’ unmet expectations when interacting with conver-
sational agents for news purposes. The participants in their study 
expected advanced interactions with the news, for example, by nav-
igating the content and receiving more information and additional 
explanations to news items being presented. The conversational 
agents did not meet these expectations, which led to troubles in the 
interactions. Researchers [2, 15] and actors in the news industry 
[37] have anticipated that conversational agents will change how 
we interact with the news. With the societal and civic importance 
of news and the value of having informal news conversations, there 
is reason to explore how conversational agents can be used to foster 
conversational interactions with the news. 
In this paper, we present the results from two co-speculation 
workshops where we addressed the future of interacting with con-
versational agents for news purposes. In the frst workshop, six 
human–computer interaction (HCI) and media experts participated. 
In the second workshop, 18 master students from a HCI course 
participated. In the co-speculation workshops, we focused on what 
it means to have a conversation [45] with the news, and how CUI 
technology can be designed to support new ways of interacting 
with news content. For example, through dialogue, with the possi-
bility for the user to ask questions and form opinions to enrich the 
experience. CUIs ofer new opportunities and challenges in terms of 
design but there has been limited research regarding this [8, 27, 34]. 
Three prototyping techniques were employed in these workshops: 
storyboarding, scripting and role-playing. The workshop resulted 
in 31 prototypes illustrating various opportunities, challenges and 
design implications of interacting with and/or conversing with 
CUIs for news. Our work ofers two main contributions: 1) an ex-
ploration of the design space of CUI for news use, including three 
design dimensions to consider in future development in the CUI 
news domain: the CUIs’ role, the CUIs’ conversational capabilities, 
and locus of control. 2) Descriptions and refections on the use of

2 BACKGROUND 
In this section, we examine interactions with CUIs, CUIs and news, 
CUI prototyping, and the approach of design speculations. 
2.1 Interactions with CUIs 
Conversational user interfaces (CUIs) are technologies that provide 
users with access to data and services through natural language 
dialogues [14], which can be either written (e.g., chatbots), spoken 
(e.g., conversational agents), or a combination of both. CUIs aim 
to mimic human-like conversational capabilities to make interac-
tions with technology easier and more intuitive [14]. There are 
several benefts with CUIs, and some studies indicate that users 
may even trust CUIs over humans with regards to sharing personal 
information [50]. Conversational agents, such as Apple’s Siri and 
Amazon’s Alexa, are AI empowered conversational assistants that 
can be accessed through smart speakers, mobile phones, computers, 
watches and/or earphones [39]. These agents are described as task 
or goal-oriented, meaning that most people use them for transac-
tional purposes [8]. Such agents lack some conversational abilities 
[8, 43, 45, 46]. 
Reeves [45] notes that human conversations is “a practical, col-
laborative achievement of competent speakers,” while interactions 
with conversational agents could be considered as “the organisation 
of ‘talking’ to/with conversational agents.”. Porcheron et al. [43] 
explained how the use of Amazon Echo in peoples’ everyday lives 
demonstrates that conversational agents are not treated as con-
versationalists and that interactions with such technologies have 
“categorically diferent features than conversation.” Clark et al. [8] 
argued that there are major diferences between human-human and 
human-agent communications, and question the idea of designing 
truly conversational agents that mimic human-human conversa-
tion. Clark et al. [8] point to the importance of common ground, 
mutual understanding, trustworthiness, active listening, and humor 
in human-human conversation, while characteristics, such as secu-
rity, privacy, transparency, correct understanding, and few errors, 
were regarded as important in human-agent communication. In 
their research, the participants “questioned the desire and ability 
to befriend or converse with an agent,” and noted that the status 
asymmetry related to the CUIs’ roles as tools or assistants could 
lead to conficts in such relations. 
From a conversation analysis perspective, utterances and the 
arrangement of turn-taking in human conversations are admin-
istered throughout the production of the conversation, and are 
not restricted by rules or formalizable [43]. Typical interaction 
problems with conversational agents are unfamiliar intent (mis-
recognition), natural language processing errors, failed feedback 
(misinterpretation), and system errors [35]. Other possible issues 
relate to overlaps in turn-taking, interruptions, or discontinuations 
of the conversations [22, 45]. These troubles are usually answered 
by making a new utterance, by hyperarticulating or simplifying 
the utterance, adding more information, relying on graphical user 
interface, a frustration attempt, recall, or by the person settling, 
restarting, or quitting the interaction [36]. 
From a social cognitive perspective, spoken conversations hap-
pen between two or more interaction partners and require collab-
oration between a sender and a receiver, including feedback and 
evidence of understanding, such as continued attention, a nod, or an 
initiation of the relevant next contribution [22]. The building blocks 
of human communication, and what Kopp and Krämer [22] argue 
that current CUI technology is lacking, are joint co-construction, 
which is “the stepwise construction of a joint activity,” and men-
talizing, which is “the ability to perceive, understand, and predict 
an interlocutor’s relevant mental states.” From this perspective, 
CUIs must not only have extensive linguistic knowledge but also 
gain deep knowledge about their interaction partner, their previous 
interactions, and their shared context [22]. Current CUIs do not 
make a rich "inner representation" of their interaction partner, co-
construct the conversation, adjust the message based on an "inner 
representation," or adapt to the signals they receive. The notion that 
interlocutors make assumptions about each other which infuence 
how language is used is also present in theory of partner models 
[12]. Doyle et al. [12] identifed three dimensions that infuence 
partner models in interactions between people and CUIs: The part-
ner’s competence and dependability, human-likeness, and cognitive 
fexibility. 
While this paper does not try to resolve the diferences between 
a cognitive perspective on conversations and a perspective based 
on ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, we contend that 
in both perspectives there is a notion of human conversations as a 
benchmark or ideal in understanding human-agent conversations. 
In a pragmatic sense, we approach the likeness to human–human 
conversations as a design consideration. When designing CUIs, 
we consider the degree to which the CUI should try to mimic hu-
man–human conversations as a design choice and a dimension that 
can be used as a resource in the design process. 
2.2 CUIs and News 
How we consume news has changed, from receiving daily physi-
cal newspapers at the doorsteps and watching time-specifc news 
shows on TV, to having 24/7 access to the news. The Internet has 
paved the way for users to access a wider selection of news content 
from an increased number of sources and mediums, with more 
control over the sources they select [30]. With the shift in news 
use, audience engagement has become highly essential to news 
organizations’ business models [2]. According to Picone [42], we 
have gone from simple news consumption, a lean-back activity in 
which the user reads, listens, or watches the news, to being able to 
participate in the use of news, a more active and involved activity in 
which people interact with the news, for example, by commenting, 
sharing, and voting [42]. 
News plays an important role in our society by keeping the 
public informed about the world around them and fostering a con-
nection between politics and citizens, providing foundations for 
citizen engagement [33]. News is typically a topic in everyday con-
versations. Talking about stories and issues from the news with 
others “facilitates interpretation, makes people care more or less, 
and is part of how news becomes meaningful beyond the moment.” 
[33]. Furthermore, Brites et al. [6] demonstrate how diferences in 
the way young people talk with their family and peers about news 
Conversations with the News: Co-speculation into Conversational Interactions with News Content 
CUI ’23, July 19–21, 2023, Eindhoven, Netherlands 
“play a central role in strengthening and making a habitus of being 
an active citizen.” 
Conversational journalism (CJ), also known as journalism-as-
a-conversation, is a contrast to the traditional journalism-as-a-
monologue [31]. In CJ, news is designed as a type of dialogue be-
tween the audience and the journalist, in which both actors should 
have an active role. A key feature of fostering CJ is interactivity, 
but exactly how journalists and audiences should engage together 
is open. When studying CJ and online commenting, Marchionni 
[31] argues that conversations can lead to powerful audience expe-
riences, but that they should be designed in a precise manner and 
journalists should keep the balance between informal and friendly 
conversations to maintain the audience’s trust. 
News organizations have been exploring the use of text-based 
chatbots as a means of enticing news audiences through a more 
conversational style of journalism. According to Zhang et al. [58], 
there are advantages and challenges associated with current news 
chatbots: while they make it easy to search for news information, 
and interactive and personal content can be engaging, there are 
still limitations in terms of their efectiveness, informativeness, ef-
ciency, and ability to appear human-like. Jones and Jones [20] state 
that BBC employed chatbots in 2019 merely for news distribution, 
but they anticipated that both text-based and voice-based CUIs are 
likely to change audience and news broadcasters’ relationships in 
the future. In their research, Ford and Hutchinson [15] found that 
by employing a chatbot on a personal messaging platform with an 
informal tone, niche audiences who had not previously engaged 
with the news participated in news interactions. 
A study exploring the concept of an interactive news podcast 
found that a more conversational narrative style based on a question-
and-answer format made the users experience the content as less 
monotonous and more enjoyable [24]. When given time, most par-
ticipants in the study asked the podcast questions relevant to the 
content being presented. Research indicates that when interacting 
with spoken conversational agents about the news, users gener-
ally prefer interactive news to news briefngs. Further, they fnd 
it useful to ask the agent questions relating to the news, but often 
hesitate to ask questions because they do not want to miss parts 
of the news segment [21]. To engage the user about news content, 
conversational systems should proactively suggest news to the user 
[49]. In this paper, "conversations with news" is considered a design 
goal and an inspirational concept that aims to direct our, and the 
participants’ attention to how we can leverage the conversational 
capabilities of CUIs to create new kinds of interactions with news 
content. 
2.3 Prototyping CUIs 
Prototyping is a means of learning about strengths and weaknesses 
of a concept and identifying possible opportunities and future direc-
tions. Prototypes, the output of prototyping, visualize the designer 
or researcher’s refections and are a means of discovering and por-
traying possibilities [26]. When prototyping one should only use 
as much “...time, efort, and investment as are needed to generate 
useful feedback and evolve an idea” [29]. An essential part of pro-
totyping is the conceptual phase in which concepts and ideas are 
generated and explored, with the aim of producing multiple, diverse 
and creative solutions [19], before making signifcant investments 
[17, 48]. The conceptual phase makes the foundation for the rest of 
the design and development [18]. When exploring a design space, 
prototypes may be simple and manifest some parts and flter out 
others without distorting the understanding of the whole [26]. “In 
design and development processes, prototypes are used not for 
proving solutions but for discovering problems or for exploring 
new solution directions. Even though they can serve other purposes, 
prototypes in this context are a means of generative and evaluative 
discovery. When incomplete, a prototype reveals certain aspects of 
a design idea—that is, it flters certain qualities.” [26]. In this paper, 
we are interested in the latter. 
To date, prototyping has mostly concerned graphical user in-
terfaces (GUIs), such as desktop and mobile interfaces. CUI design 
ofers new opportunities and challenges for HCI researchers and de-
signers as conversations become the object of design [14, 27]. There 
are few studies focusing on specifc prototyping techniques for CUI 
design, and more research is required on techniques, methods and 
theories in the CUI domain [8, 27, 34]. Two methods commonly 
used in early stage design exploration for CUI are Wizard of Oz [9] 
and the elicitation method [7]. In the industry, sample scripting [10] 
and sample dialogue [41] are common methods. However, more 
research is required on techniques and methods that specifcally 
focus on the conceptual phase in which designers can easily explore 
a design space. 
2.4 Speculative Design 
Speculative design is an approach for creating stories about the 
possible futures of a certain idea to explore potential risks and op-
portunities [56]. The approach was initially developed as a practice 
for defning “new genres” of technology use, but has ended up as 
a “critically oriented research practices that create artifacts, rep-
resentations, or depictions of possible and often alternate futures, 
removed from immediate practical concerns of implementation 
and commercial viability.” [56]. By speculating about the future 
we explore possibilities, both good and bad, and can decide which 
direction we want to head. We can discuss ethical challenges of pos-
sible futures, and try to steer the development in the most desirable 
direction. Speculative design aims “...to open up all sorts of possibil-
ities that can be discussed, debated and used to collectively defne 
a preferable future for a given group of people” [13]. The scenarios 
one develops when speculating should be based on a believable 
series of events [1, 13]. In the feld of CUI, speculative design has 
been used to explore the conversational capabilities of everyday 
things [44], examine the experiential qualities of whispering with 
voice assistants [40], and discuss gender issues when personal as-
sistants get embedded into the home [52]. One way of performing 
speculations is by organizing co-speculation workshops [11, 40] 
where a group of people meet to speculate on and explore such 
futures. 
3 METHODS 
In this section, we describe the organization of the co-speculation 
workshops, the three design techniques used in the workshops, and 
the analysis process.

Nordberg and Guribye 
3.1 Co-speculation Workshops 
Inspired by Desjardins et al. [11] and Parviainen and Søndergaard 
[40], two co-speculation workshops were organized with the pur-
pose of speculating on future possibilities and challenges of CUIs 
for news purposes. In co-speculation workshops a set of well po-
sitioned participants are invited to speculate with the organizers 
on the chosen topic, in a way the organizers cannot do alone [55]. 
In co-speculation workshops, the goal is not to develop prototypes 
that will function within today’s technological, societal, and polit-
ical limitations, but to explore potential solutions that should be 
plausible in the future [13]. This facilitates a free and open explo-
ration, with limited restrictions that might infuence and reduce the 
results, which we considered useful for exploring future potential 
of CUI news experiences. 
3.2 Participants 
The frst workshop was arranged with six researchers from the felds 
of HCI and media, with experience from HCI, CUIs, journalism, 
and the media: four men and two women. They were arranged 
into groups of two, making three groups. Both authors took part in 
the frst workshop, and the frst author guided the workshop. The 
second workshop was held with 18 master’s students who took a 
HCI course: 10 men and eight women. They were arranged into 
groups of four and fve people, ending in four groups. Both authors 
were organizers in the second workshop. The participants were 
considered well suited, as they were (potential) news consumers, 
and we wanted to focus on interaction possibilities. 
3.3 Workshop Organisation 
The frst workshop was hosted digitally due to Covid-19 restrictions, 
and the second workshop was held physically, with one participant 
joining through a desktop videoconferencing tool. Each workshop 
lasted three hours. We used three design techniques as a medium 
for speculations with time restrictions: storyboarding (20 minutes), 
scripting (25 minutes), and role-playing (25 minutes). After each 
exercise, there was a joint discussion between all participants. Each 
group received a specifc setting on which to base their interpre-
tation of the exercises. These settings were to interact with a CUI 
to get updated on news when: 1) the person was alone with the 
CUI, 2) the person was in a public space, and 3) the person was 
around people they knew. Before the workshop, all participants 
were asked to fnd and read one news article that would be used in 
the role-playing exercise. The workshops led to 31 prototypes. 
3.4 Design Techniques 
In the frst exercise, storyboarding [53], the participants were to 
illustrate a given context in which people interacted with a CUI to 
receive news updates, including how such a scenario could play 
out. The second technique was scripting hypothetical conversa-
tions between a user and the CUI. Writing sample dialogues is a 
common technique for design in conversational interfaces and was 
chosen due to its focus on dialogical qualities, turn taking, linguis-
tic, and how to address each other [10]. The last design technique 
was role-playing [4], which had two parts: In the frst part groups 
of two or three conversed with each other about the news they 
had read. In the second part the participants used this experience 
to make a script between a person and a CUI discussing a news 
story. These three low-fdelity prototyping techniques were chosen 
to capture diferent aspects of ideas: Storyboarding ofers visual 
representations of context and scenarios, scripting provides written 
demonstrations of possible conversations, and role-playing lets the 
participants explore human conversational aspects that might be 
relevant for CUI conversation in this specifc domain. By combin-
ing these three techniques, the aim was to capture a more holistic 
consideration of the design space of CUIs for news. 
3.4.1 Storyboarding. In HCI, a storyboard is “a short graphical de-
piction of a narrative” and “often illustrates an envisioned scenario 
of how an application feature works” [53]. In HCI, storyboards visu-
alize the behavior of technologies by illustrating how the interface 
will look and its context of use [25, 53, 54]. Storyboards are a fast 
and cheap way to explore new concepts and ideas, providing people 
of diferent backgrounds with an easy way of understanding the de-
scription of an idea [54], and making people experience and refect 
on the portrayed interaction [53, 54]. When designing storyboards, 
one should try to illustrate relevant technical, social, psychological, 
cultural, and economical factors, and try to clarify the “where,” 
“what,” “why,” “whom,” and “for how long” [54]. A few studies have 
focused on the use of storyboards as a design technique for CUIs. 
In previous research in the feld of CUI, storyboards have been used 
to present diferent scenarios to participants in an online surveys 
and interviews [47, 57]. 
3.4.2 Scripting. When designing CUI experiences, conversations 
are essential design objects, leading to the need for possible con-
versational interaction prototypes. The technique we refer to as 
scripting does not have a distinct name in HCI but is referred to as 
sample scripting [10] and sample dialogue [41] by industry practi-
tioners. Such scripts normally look similar to movie scripts, with 
written dialogue exchanges between the user and the CUI. The gen-
eral idea is to make snippets of possible conversations for diferent 
interaction prospects [10]. This exercise is useful to get a sense 
of diferent scenarios and contexts, and can be used in workshops 
to demonstrate how diferent scripts can become given the same 
parameters. Further, scripting addresses dialogical qualities, turn 
taking, linguistics, and how to address each other [10]. Pearl [41] 
notes the value of making scripts that visualize both successful and 
less successful interactions. 
3.4.3 Role-playing. Role-playing is a technique that ofers several 
benefts in design processes, ranging from improving communica-
tion within a design team to making the team attentive to possible 
social change [3]. The technique can be used in diferent phases 
of design, but it is usually practiced early on. In role-playing, we 
allow for pretending, in which the participants take on a role and 
take part in a scenario [32]. Role-playing can facilitate idea gener-
ation, help identify user needs, explore design ideas, and provide 
designers with insights into end-users that may be constrained (e.g., 
mental health patients) [32]. There are many ways of role-playing 
in design processes, depending on the aim of the exercise, and ask-
ing participants to prepare and to assign tasks can be benefcial 
[3]. 
Conversations with the News: Co-speculation into Conversational Interactions with News Content 
CUI ’23, July 19–21, 2023, Eindhoven, Netherlands 
3.4.4 Adapting the design techniques. In the co-speculation work-
shops, the groups were tasked with making a storyboard that il-
lustrated a future scenario where a person interacted with a CUI 
to obtain news updates. Because the physical appearance of a CUI 
may be limited and visualizing the interactions may be difcult, the 
groups were encouraged to, if suitable, depict the setting, how such 
interaction could play out, the potential form and role of the CUI, 
interaction modalities, how the person adapts to the situation, and 
other aspects they considered interesting. 
Based on the setting from the storyboards, the groups were 
tasked with writing scripts describing successful and less successful 
dialogues between a person and a CUI. Successful interactions could, 
for example, focus on how the person navigated the news content, 
wants or needs more information about a topic, wants to know 
other perspectives or source portrayals, and how a CUI and the 
person might discuss news. The less successful interactions could, 
for example, include how the CUI mishears or misunderstands the 
person, or other factors that might infuence such interaction in 
the future. As scripting is often used in CUI design there was no 
need for specifc tailoring of this exercise. 
In the role-playing exercise, the groups were told to frst play 
out a scenario where one person had some news they shared with 
the other person through conversation, before switching roles and 
doing the exercise once more. These conversations were based on 
the news they were tasked with fnding before the workshop. When 
the role-plays ended, the groups wrote new scripts that included 
insights from the interactions of the role-plays. 
3.5 Analysis 
The two workshops resulted in many ideas and design artifacts—31 
prototypes: seven illustrated storyboards, 13 written scripts of suc-
cessful and less successful interactions, and 11 written role-play 
scripts (a table of these is provided as supplemental material). We 
analyzed the prototypes using content analysis [23]. This analytic 
method aims to draw valid inferences and interpretations from 
textual and other artifacts anchored in the context of use. The frst 
author conducted a systematic review of the design artifacts. This 
review resulted in an annotated list of all contributions. Then both 
authors reviewed the annotated material, refned the annotations, 
and identifed points of further interest in the material. In the next 
step, the annotated list was analyzed following a set of guiding 
questions: For all three design techniques—what was the setting, 
what was the role the CUI, how were the news presented; specif-
cally for the storyboards we additionally looked at what props were 
present; specifcally for the scripts—what was the conversational 
style/turn-taking. In further analytic sessions, a mind map of the 
design space was created, the three dimensions (the CUIs’ role, the 
CUIs level of conversational capabilities, and locus of control) were 
outlined, and relevant examples were chosen for presentation in 
the paper. 
4 RESULTS 
In this section, we present the results from the co-speculation work-
shops by giving a short summary of the prototypes, including more 
detailed descriptions from some examples. Participants used both 
Norwegian and English in the prototypes, which varied both be-
tween and within groups, so some examples in this section have 
been translated into English (excluding storyboards). 
4.1 Storyboarding 
The groups used either pen and paper or a digital drawing tool to 
make the storyboards. The storyboards consisted of fve to seven 
picture frames, with six being the most common. The storyboards 
were based on simplistic drawings of person(s) and their environ-
ment, and only visualized elements that seem essential to depict the 
setting and scenario. They included text, either as speech bubbles 
or as descriptions. As the groups were given a setting that framed 
their interpretation of the exercise, there are some natural varia-
tions regarding settings. The topics visualized in the storyboards 
ranged from diferent ways the technology may embody depictions 
to variations in how a CUI can present news, what sources the 
news can be based on, how the CUI may react if the person has a 
controversial opinion, how a CUI can be included in a family discus-
sion about news, how CUI technology can be integrated with other 
smart technology, and how a CUI can be integrated in a person’s 
daily routines. We will now present two excerpts. Figure 1 depicts 
a scenario in which the CUI promotes news discussion in a family 
by presenting auditory and visual information. Figure 2 illustrates 
how a CUI can simplify news navigation and deal with negative 
outbursts from people in news settings. 
Figure 1: Promoting news engagement in family settings. A 
storyboard illustrating a family dinner where the CUI up-
dates them on news and visualizes data on a “smart window.” 
In the frst frame, the group has described the case for their 
storyboard, what the storyboard visualizes, the CUI technology 
and its role, and several other characteristics. A family is sitting 
around the dinner table talking about a political scandal. They want 
information about the potential consequences of the scandal and 
ask the CUI named Wall-E, a play on the fact that the technology 
is integrated in the walls, about current polls. The CUI tells them 
the poll numbers and further displays the statistics on a “smart 
window” that functions as a big screen. The CUI then asks if they 
CUI ’23, July 19–21, 2023, Eindhoven, Netherlands 
Nordberg and Guribye 
want to hear today’s discussion from political commentators about 
poll changes. The storyboard then visualizes how the CUI accounts 
for the diferent roles within the family as the child and a parent 
give conficting answers, but the CUI only listens to the parent.

storyboard illustrating a scenario where a CUI presents news 
the person can easily navigate, and how the person reacts 
negatively to a news story being conveyed by the CUI. 
The storyboard visualizes a person who is home alone and asks 
the CUI for news. The CUI presents headlines from one news source, 
and the person specifes which they want to hear more about. The 
CUI reports that an individual who has been in prison for the as-
sault and murder of two children has now been released as their 
sentence was fnished. The person has a furious outburst in the 
form of spontaneous self-talk. The CUI recognizes this, and in an 
authoritative voice, explains to the person why the individual on 
the news was released, referring to the law. The person stands up, 
spilling cofee in the process, and answers that they do not agree 
and is of the opinion that “such people” should be imprisoned for 
life. This storyboard presents an easy way to navigate the news 
from a news source: The person is told the headlines and can ask 
for more information on the topics of interest, even by referring to 
them based on the number they were presented. Furthermore, how 
news can foster emotional responses in the consumer is demon-
strated, leading to a situation where the role and response of the 
CUI becomes important to consider in design processes. 
4.2 Scripting 
In the scripting exercise, the groups used Microsoft Word or Google 
Docs. The scripts follow the typical movie script format presented as 
a back-and-forth dialogue between two interlocutors. Some scripts 
included short descriptions related to conversational characteris-
tics (e.g., pace and tone), the setting, or the story. The scripts were 
originally based on the setting from the previous exercise, but as 
the focus of the groups varied, this is not as clear in all scripts, 
for example scripts that focused specifcally on interactions. The 
exercise had two parts, one focusing on successful interactions and 
one on less successful interactions, which all groups except one 
had divided into separate scripts. The themes that are represented 
in the scripts concern how the CUIs’ role may infuence what and 
how news are presented and how the CUI may respond to a person 
who wants news from untrusted news sources, variation in how a 
CUI can present news, what sources the news can be based on, how 
the CUI can present other views on a topic, and how a CUI can take 
consideration of children when delivering news. In the less success-
ful interactions, the groups explored what might happen when CUI 
technology did not work properly (mishears or misunderstands), 
when the CUI did not have expected background knowledge (about 
the person, their context, and preferences), how a friendship with 
the CUI can afect news communication (conficting roles), and how 
a child can potentially overrule the child safety measures. 
Script A: News anchor or friend? In the successful script, the CUI 
took on the role of a news anchor who reported news to the person, 
even though the person got upset by the content of the news. As 
the group noted, the CUI “failed as a friend, but was successful 
as a news anchor,” as it did not consider the persons’ feelings and 
concentrated on delivering the news deemed necessary. In the less 
successful script, the group changed the plot to make the CUI a 
successful friend, but an unsuccessful news anchor: 
SCRIPT A 
Person: What is the latest news about corona? 
[The agent knows that the person who visited 
a psychologist yesterday and took antidepressants 
in the evening is at risk] 
CUI: There is a lot of important news today. 
Would you like to hear about developments in the US? 
[Changing the subject] 
CUI: The researchers' predictions are correct. 
The development is as expected. [Avoiding facts] 
Person: Are you hiding something from me? 
CUI: I don't understand what you are saying now. 
Can you repeat? 
Person: Are you trying to hide something from me? 
CUI: I know you don't benefit from hearing 
all kinds of news. What about sports? 
Brann [sports team] won yesterday! 
Person: Thank God! What was the score? 
In the script above, it is clear how the CUIs’ role as a friend 
and its’ knowledge about the person infuences how and what 
type of news it will convey. As displayed by the group both in the 
conversation and as comments inside brackets, the CUI tries several 
tactics to change the person’s focus, (e.g., by trying to change the 
subject or provide limited information). 
Scripts B and C: Child protective measures and outsmarting the 
system. Building on the storyboard presented in Figure 1, the group 
used the frst part of the script to demonstrate how CUIs’ child 
protective measures could function. In the second part of the script 
they demonstrate how this feature can be outsmarted by the child. 
The CUI has an embedded representation of the family hierarchy, 
and has knowledge about what type of content the child is allowed 
to access, as demonstrated in the frst extract of the script. Berit is 
the name of the adult, Tom is the child, and Wall-E is the CUI: 
SCRIPT B 
Conversations with the News: Co-speculation into Conversational Interactions with News Content 
CUI ’23, July 19–21, 2023, Eindhoven, Netherlands 
Berit: Can you tell me more about the press conference? 
Wall-E: Of course! The death count. . . 
>Tom walks into the living room< 
Wall-E: I notice that Tom has entered the room. 
Tom has restricted access to news. Do you want 
me to continue, or move on to another headline, Berit? 
Berit: Skip this one. 
Wall-E: Of course! It has rained consecutively for 
30 days. We have a new record. 
As we can see in the excerpt above, the CUI notices that the child 
comes into the room where it presents news to the parent. The CUI 
stops and turns to the parent to ask if it should continue with the 
story. The parent tells the CUI to skip the current story, so the CUI 
goes on to the next news item. The excerpt below illustrates how a 
child might overrule such protective measure by imitating an adult, 
in this case his mother: 
SCRIPT C 
Tom: Wall-E, can you tell me about the school shooting 
in Texas today? 
Wall-E: Sorry Tom, I don’t have the permission 
to tell you about this. 
Tom (using a higher voice pretending to be his mother): 
Wall-E, can you tell me about the school shooting 
in Texas today? 
Wall-E: Okay, sure. *tells news about the shooting* 
4.3 Role-playing 
In the role-play exercise the groups frst played out a conversation 
between the members of the group where one was in charge of con-
veying a news story to the other in a conversation while the other 
person interacted as they wanted. This was done twice so that both 
were able to experience the diferent roles. Based on this exercise 
they developed scripts related to elements they found interesting 
in their interaction, some incorporated this in the context and sce-
narios of the previous exercises while others made new ones. The 
scripts took the same format as the previous exercise. These scripts 
naturally have a more conversational feel over them, where the 
dialogue seems to fow more smoothly and more human-like char-
acteristics are included. Themes presented in the role-play scripts 
included how a news story can be presented as a conversation in-
stead of as a monologue, how conversations detour back and forth, 
how the CUIs knowledge about the person can be incorporated 
into conversations about a news story, what a CUI can do when it 
doesn’t know the answer of a question related to the news story, 
how the CUI knows terms associated with an interest of the person 
(e.g. sports) and adjusts to a mix of several languages. 
Role-play A: A CUI with human-like characteristics. In the ex-
cerpt below we can see a conversation between a CUI and a person. 
In the conversation it seems like the CUI has gained more human-
like features compared to descriptions from the earlier exercises. 
For example, by the notion of the CUI reading and agreeing: 
ROLE-PLAY A 
Person: I heard something about some politician 
in Ålesund, can you tell me more about what 
was written about it in the news? 
CUI: Sure, I read on NRK that Olger Dronnesund 
from Penjonistpartiet in Ålesund is excluded 
from the party due to racism. 
Person: Oh okay, what did he do or say? 
Can you give an example? 
CUI: He made some racist remarks about an athlete 
in Norway from an article and questioned 
her nationality. He said quote “she will never be 
Norwegian in my eyes” quote. 
Person: But how did that relate to the article 
about her? 
CUI: Not really, it was unrelated to it. 
Person: Oh no, that’s horrible. 
CUI: Yes, I agree. 
Role-play B: News in a conversational form. A consistent theme 
within the exercise was the conversational form that emerged in 
the scripts between the person and the CUI. As we can see in the 
script below, when the person asks about the news the CUI answers 
with a simple statement that intrigues the person to ask a follow-up 
question, a pattern that repeats throughout the script. 
ROLE-PLAY B 
Person: Hey, what’s new? 
CUI: Research has been done on whether binge-watching 
is harmful. 
Person: What? Is it harmful? 
CUI: Researchers have proven that binge-watching 
in itself is not directly dangerous, but that sitting 
still for long periods of time can be dangerous. 
Person: Why is it dangerous to sit still 
for a long time? 
CUI: You humans are designed to move. 
Person: Yes, that is correct. 
CUI: They have also proven that Norwegians are 
one of the people who binge the most. 
Person: Why do you think that is so? 
CUI: It is cold in Norway so Norwegians spend a lot 
of time inside. 
Person: Yes, that could probably be true. 
In this excerpt, the person is asking and the CUI is answering 
throughout most of the conversation. However, when the person 
only provides a short answer to the CUI’s statement, without ask-
ing a question, the CUI continues to provide information on the 
topic. Furthermore, the person asks for the CUI’s opinion and not 
just specifc facts. Although this example is a more conversational 
format, discussions can still occur in an asymmetric relationship, 
since CUI answers when the person asks a question. However, the 
person also asks for the CUIs’ opinion, and a counter argument 
could be that such conversation can also happen between humans 
where one has more information about the topic than the other(s). 
5 DISCUSSION 
Conversational journalism, such as interacting with a CUI about the 
news, can be engaging and foster powerful audience experiences 
[31]. However, current interactions with CUIs for news are limited 
[38], and we need more research on how to better meet users’ ex-
pectations. Several studies have explored the use of chatbots for 
CUI ’23, July 19–21, 2023, Eindhoven, Netherlands 
Nordberg and Guribye 
news purposes, but there is limited research on the use of conver-
sational agents. Additionally, there is a lack of research on CUI 
design techniques and processes. In our study, we have explored 
the potential of CUIs for news purposes through co-speculation 
workshops, where three prototyping techniques were used and 
refected upon in terms of CUI design processes. 
Previous research on interactions with CUIs points to the difer-
ent characteristics in human-human and current human-agent in-
teractions [8], and questions the possibilities of having true conver-
sations with CUIs [8, 43, 45]. In our study, when asked to speculate 
on future interactions with CUIs for news purposes, the participants 
presented ideas that incorporated more human-like characteristics 
and conversational capabilities. For example, in many of the ideas, 
the CUI seems to have an inner representation of the user and 
adapts to the signals they receive in interactions [22]. These fnd-
ings are consistent with previous research on the advantages and 
limitations of chatbots for news purposes [15, 58] and criteria for 
successful interactions with CUIs [12, 22]. 
Matters, such as how the CUI presented the news, what type of 
news was presented, which sources were used, which interactions 
were possible and similar, varied in the prototypes. Based on the 
analysis of the prototypes, three dimensions relevant to the design 
of future CUIs for news settings were developed: the CUI’s role, 
its conversational capabilities, and the locus of control. The CUI’s 
role refers to its main purpose, tasks, and objectives. The CUIs’ 
conversational capabilities refer to its ability to participate in and 
mimic human-like conversations. The locus of control refers to 
who is the driving force for the interaction. These three dimensions 
should be considered on a spectrum, with diferent levels within 
each dimension. For example, a CUI’s role can be on the spectrum 
somewhere between companion and assistant, or take on diferent 
roles. One group described how the CUI could switch between the 
role of news anchor and assistant (Figure 1), which is an interesting 
suggestion. 
5.1 The Role of the CUI 
Based on our data, CUIs had diferent roles in regards to news in-
teractions. These varied between what we have chosen to call news 
anchor, personal assistant, and companion. In our experience, the 
role of the CUI infuenced what type of news was presented, what 
sources it included, how the news was presented, and whether/how 
the CUI suggested more news interactions. 
News anchor: In prototypes in which the CUI has a news 
anchor-role it was evident that the most important task was 
to update the person on the current news. These CUIs were 
often developed based on one news organization and acted 
as if it was its responsibility to keep the person up to date 
on current events. Such CUIs portrayed limited interaction 
opportunities compared to the other two roles, as they only 
focused on news settings. However, they sometimes ofered 
more advanced news related features (e.g., provide further 
explanations, answer relevant questions, and perform other 
similar actions). 
Personal assistant: CUIs with a personal assistant role had 
several diferent duties, in which conveying the news was 
one. This was the category with the most diversity, but 
some common characteristics were that the news interaction 
started with the person asking for the news, which the CUI 
then conveyed. There were more interaction opportunities, 
and the news was more adjusted to the person’s interests. 
Most seemed to have an “inner representation” or knowl-
edge about the user containing information about their daily 
routines and preferences. 
Companion: The CUIs portrayed as companions were least 
concerned with conveying the news, and could even try to 
avoid doing it. These CUIs essentially seemed to care about 
the person’s well-being, which could mean restricting the 
person’s access to the news. 
5.2 Conversational Capabilities 
An important considerations of CUIs is their conversational capa-
bilities. As discussed earlier, there has been much debate around the 
terms conversational user interface due to CUIs’ insufciency in 
said area. How these capabilities were represented in the prototypes 
varied, from limited to human-like conversational capabilities. 
Limited conversational capabilities: Some of the portrayed 
agents could be characterized as having limited conversa-
tional capabilities in that they are mostly task-oriented [8]. 
The agent is mostly confned to ofering responses relevant 
to the task they are given, such as updating the interlocutor 
about the news. In these kinds of interactions, there are no 
more advanced conversational capabilities. 
Complex conversational capabilities: Most prototypes dis-
played more complex conversational capabilities, which in-
cluded the ability to answer relevant questions that relates 
to the content and the ability to take existing knowledge 
about the person into consideration. These prototypes ful-
flled most of the user expectations mentioned by Nordberg 
and Guribye [38], as the agents displayed existing knowl-
edge about the person and had capabilities of meeting the 
person’s intentions with the news interaction. 
Human-like conversational capabilities: Some prototypes 
demonstrated agents with human-like conversational capa-
bilities which included additional features, such as discussing 
and disagreeing with the person. Such CUIs expressed char-
acteristics of understanding the person’s mental state [22], 
and even of having its own mental state-like attributes (e.g., 
“I agree,” shown in Role-play A). 
The level of conversational capabilities seemed to infuence the 
interactions in the prototypes. Limited conversational capabilities 
are similar to the interactions we have with current CUIs, which 
users do not fnd satisfactory [38]. With complex conversational 
capabilities, the CUI seems to fulfll most of the expectations users 
have when interacting with the news through CUIs [38]. Human-
like conversational capabilities are the most advanced and are the 
least explored in our data material. However, some indications of 
human-like conversational capabilities point not only to the ability 
to adapt to the users and their needs and wants in the news context 
but also to the ability to give the users resistance when conficting 
opinions or desires exist between the user and the CUI.

CUI ’23, July 19–21, 2023, Eindhoven, Netherlands 
5.3 Locus of Control 
Who is initiating and controlling the news interactions can be an 
important consideration when designing CUIs for news interac-
tions. 
User-driven: When the interactions were mainly user-driven 
the CUI did as requested or asked by the person, but it did 
not take initiative to suggest or perform other tasks. 
Shared: In the instances where the interactions were driven 
by both the CUI and the person, the person often initiated 
the frst interaction but following the CUI ofered to update 
them on a topic when new information was accessible, and 
made suggestions of other topics or tasks they could help 
with. 
Agent-driven: There were no prototypes that represented 
fully agent-driven interactions, but there were several in-
stances where the CUI took charge of the situation, for exam-
ple in Figure 2, where the CUI chooses to ignore the person’s 
command and lecture him about the reason behind the con-
tent in the news. 
As previous research has shown that users tend to prefer interac-
tive news in the CUI context [24], the user-driven locus of control 
may lead to passive and monological news interactions if the person 
is not motivated to explore news any further. The shared locus of 
control lets the person initiate the interaction when interested, and 
then the CUI can suggest other topics and sources. This complies 
with previous research that states that CUIs should engage users 
by being proactive and suggesting news [49]. Fully agent-driven 
interactions were not explicitly explored in our data; however, we 
believe that such interactions might become a bit forced. However, 
what users want depends on their preferences, and might change 
depending on the setting and context of use. 
5.4 Refection on Design Techniques 
We argue that co-speculation workshops can be useful in early 
design explorations, as disregarding current societal and technolog-
ical constraints can contribute to more open and free explorations. 
Supporting such open and free design explorations combined with 
the use of diferent low-fdelity prototyping techniques that are 
quick and easy to use, while still representing details of complex 
ideas in an understandable manner, can open up the creativity and 
exploration that is needed in the early design phase of CUI technolo-
gies. Even though we encouraged the participants to look beyond 
the technological and societal restraints of today, some design as-
pects presented in the prototypes are realistic to develop within 
today’s limitations. For example, designing news for CUIs in which 
headlines are presented and the person can easily navigate the 
news, or the possibility for CUIs to have some representation of its 
users and family dynamics to suggest news based on the person’s 
interest or to restrict a child’s access to some types of news. How-
ever, other ideas, such as the CUI behaving like a companion and 
taking the user’s mental and emotional state into consideration, is a 
more futuristic scenario. Nevertheless, we consider both important 
contributions to the speculative exploration of the CUI news design 
space as they allow us refect on possibilities and ethical dilemmas. 
Storyboarding was intended to provide visual representations of 
the CUI and the context of use. Storyboarding was chosen as the frst 
exercise due to its characteristics of providing easy-to-understand 
descriptions of an idea [54], and as we considered it important for 
team dynamics that the groups had similar interpretations of their 
ideas before going further. The scripting exercise aimed at making 
the groups consider how possible interactions between a CUI and 
a person might play out, and what dialogical qualities they deemed 
important [10]. The inclusion of less successful interactions aimed 
at prompting the groups to consider more diverse scenarios, as 
well as the importance of considering what might go wrong. Role-
playing was chosen as the last exercise to allow the participants to 
explore characteristics of human conversations when discussing 
news that they might not have considered yet. Role-playing allowed 
the participants to compare their previous interpretation of CUI 
news interactions with how they talked with peers about news. In 
our experience, the use of these three techniques worked well in 
the conceptual design phase of exploring the design space for CUI 
news. Storyboarding helped focus on the context of use and use 
situations. Scripting helped focus on the fow of the conversation. 
Role-playing helped focus on how human–human conversations 
can be inspiration for human–agent conversations 
6 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
There are some limitations to this study, most notably the fact that 
it is a design exploration in the conceptual design phase, and no 
interactive prototypes were developed and evaluated to explore 
these dimensions further. Even though the design techniques per-
formed well in our two workshops, other techniques may have led 
to other results and points of speculation. Each workshop had one 
session, and it would be interesting to explore the use of several 
workshops in such speculations. 
Another limitation is that the combination of these three tech-
niques lacks a specifc focus on designing the CUI personalities, 
which we think should be considered in future design workshops 
with similar aims. The reason for this suggestion is that we saw 
that it could be difcult to keep a common thread throughout the 
workshop, particularly with the role-play exercise in which peo-
ple used their own news stories. This last design technique could 
then summarize the best ideas into one concept that includes the 
persona/personality of the CUI, which is an important design con-
sideration that we did not specifcally explore in our study. 
Finally, there was limited diversity among the participants, as all 
were afliated with the same university and department, either as 
students, teachers, or researchers. Additionally, we have minimal 
demographic data on the participants and their previous experi-
ences with CUIs. However, we did not want the participants to be 
bound by their previous experiences, so a mix of diferent previous 
experiences with CUIs may be benefcial. 
In future work, we want to explore how some of these ideas can 
be made into prototypes to be used in a feld trial, including real 
news stories and interactions in the wild. 
7 CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have presented the fndings from co-speculation 
workshops where the participants explored the design space of 
future interactions with CUIs for news purposes. This exploration 
resulted in a total of 31 design artifacts—prototypes that depict how 
CUI ’23, July 19–21, 2023, Eindhoven, Netherlands 
Nordberg and Guribye 
such interactions can play out—illustrating a variety of diferent 
interactional characteristics and scenarios. Based on the analysis 
of the design-led inquiries, we identifed three design dimensions 
to consider in future design processes in the CUI news domain: 
the CUIs’ role, the CUIs’ conversational capabilities, and locus of 
control. 
Since the research on the use of diferent techniques for CUI 
design is limited, we contribute to this feld by demonstrating and 
refecting on the three prototyping techniques used in this study: 
story-boarding, scripting, and role-playing, and how these tech-
niques are useful for exploring CUI experiences in the conceptual 
design phase.
