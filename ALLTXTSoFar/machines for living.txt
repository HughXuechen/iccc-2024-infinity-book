This thesis describes A Machine for Living In, a digital media artwork using newly available 
computational and sensing tools to study the home as a site of intimate life. The title invokes Le 
Corbusier's modernist framing of the house as a machine to interpret the promise of contemporary 
smart home technologies. The project has two distinct phases: the construction and inhabitation of 
a functional smart home system, followed by an exhibition of processed data as a multi-part digital 
art installation. In a process of joint human-machine authorship, this system produces a complex 
portrait of the home: as a space of language, intimacy, bodily practice, and quotidian narrative. 
Compositionally, it contrasts utopian illusions of beautiful, frictionless utility with artistic 
strategies generating insight into the messy, material realities of the everyday.  
 
 
The thesis begins with three key frames of reference for the work in Bachelard’s topoanalysis, 
critical engineering design, and site-specific and systems-oriented arts production. It describes 
early projects pursing the psychological study of intimate life, leading to the current work. It 
recounts the conceptual and technical development of A Machine for Living In, and discusses the 
composition of the resulting exhibition. The thesis concludes with a speculative framing of this 
research as a kind of introspective design: a hybrid practice of targeted inquiry to provide insight 
about both human and machine.

Chapter 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 
OVERVIEW 
This thesis describes A Machine for Living In, a digital media artwork using newly available 
computational and sensing tools to study the home as a site of intimate life. The title invokes Le 
Corbusier's modernist framing of the house as a machine to interpret the promise of contemporary 
smart home technologies. The project has two distinct phases: the construction and inhabitation of 
a functional smart home system, followed by an exhibition of processed data as a multi-part digital 
art installation.  
In a process of joint human-machine authorship, this system produces a complex portrait of 
the home: as a space of language, intimacy, bodily practice, and quotidian narrative. 
Compositionally, it contrasts utopian illusions of beautiful, frictionless utility with artistic 
strategies generating insight into the messy, material realities of the everyday. The project was 
first exhibited in the Foster Art Gallery at Westminster College in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania, 
in August of 2017. 
Le Corbusier's valorization of the machine—the product of engineered utility—is resonant 
with a contemporary utopian spirit founded on the potential of ubiquitous sensing, embedded 
computing, and machine learning. Where the airplane and automobile were the models of his time, 
the computer has become our dominant metaphoric and idealized machine. 
In my doctoral studies I have explored diverse modes of human-computer interaction through 
digital art, creating poetic intersections of human and machine perception. Delving further into my 
history as an artist, I have often sought to engage the intimate circumstances of life through my 
work: whether exploring relationships, family structure, studio processes, or systems of 
 
 
2 
communication and exchange. My dissertation continues these twin threads of technical 
exploration and intimate investigation. I build on Bachelard's topoanalysis—the systematic 
psychological study of sites of intimate life—striving for similar goals through technological 
means in a process of technological topoanalysis. 
The purpose for my project is two-fold: to use emerging technologies to study the home as an 
intimate site; and in so doing, to interpret the qualities and implications of those new techniques.  
My goal is to produce a reciprocal diagnosis of human and machine. Accordingly, I combine 
methods from engineering design, psychological exploration, and art production. This work is a 
meeting of systems art, poetic topoanalysis, and machine design. 
In summary, the larger arc of my research considers how evolving technologies impact our 
most personal lives. As we live in increasingly intimate codependence with our technologies, our 
understandings of ourselves must change. This state of technological cohabitation, with all of its 
immanent potential and unforeseeable consequence, is the subject of my research for the 
foreseeable future. The practices documented in this paper point towards that broader investigation 
of machine living. I advocate for the design of introspective machines that harness the potential 
and reveal the limitations of new technologies, while bringing insight into the intimate conditions 
of the everyday.  
1.2 
STRUCTURE 
This paper is divided into five chapters.  
Chapter 1 introduces my project, potential contributions to the field, and the structure of this 
document.  
 
 
3 
In Chapter 2, Art, Technology, and Intimate Life, I articulate three key frames of reference 
for my work: engineering design, art production, and psychological exploration. I discuss the most 
relevant theories and practices for each domain.  
Chapter 3, Strategies and Explorations, illustrates my practice through early projects leading 
to the current work. I discuss formal strategies of model-limited experience, opportunistic systems, 
digital surrogacy, machine observers, joint human-computer authorship, and machine as metaphor 
as they have been developed in these past works. Each project engages different modes of intimate 
experience. 
Chapter 4, A Machine for Living In, describes the dissertation project in five sections. 
In "Arriving at Home," I describe my interest in the home as a subject in all of its experiential 
complexity: as a space of language, intimacy, bodily practice, quotidian narrative, and as the focus 
of contemporary smart home enthusiasm.  
In "Le Corbusier and Machine Living," I introduce Le Corbusier's affinity for the machine 
and his modernist conception of the house as a machine for living. I identify echoes of this spirit 
in the contemporary idealization of ubiquitous sensing, embedded computing, and machine 
learning, particularly as they combine in popular enthusiasm for the smart home. 
In "House-Machines" I establish a formal context for this project through other house works 
and art to be inhabited: architectural (Le Corbusier), cinematic (Keaton), fictional (Bradbury, 
Casares), and technoscientific (Roy).  
In “Site Observation” I describe the hardware and setup for the site-specific phase of the 
project. I identify the key experiential layers of domestic space, and match them with effective 
technologies for capturing domestic activity. I describe the sensing apparatus built, the parameters 
of site observation, and the scope of collected data. 
 
 
4 
In “Constructed Home" I describe the structure of the inaugural exhibition of this work at the 
Foster Art Gallery at Westminster College. I relate the forms and composition developed to key 
artistic references for the work. I consider the compositional problem of working with complex, 
multi-modal data: how to synthesize diverse machine observations into a singular, cohesive viewer 
experience. I describe my approach to temporal composition. I also discuss the dynamics of shared 
agency in this process of joint human-machine authorship.  
Finally, in Chapter 5, Conclusions and Future Directions, I describe new horizons for the 
work: new forms for the Machine for Living In, and future directions for the broader research 
practice. The paper concludes with a speculative framing of my work as kind of intimate science: 
a hybrid art and technology practice designing introspective technologies to provide insight about 
both human and machine.

Chapter 2. ART, TECHNOLOGY, AND INTIMATE LIFE 
My research is devoted to the domain of intimacy, to the domain in which 
psychic weight is dominant.1 
–Gaston Bachelard 
I have at various times worked as a neuroimaging researcher, experimental game designer, 
circuit designer for consumer electronics, and as a painter in a studio. This paper describes multiple 
years of digital arts research into the smart home. What unifies these diverse activities?  
Like Bachelard in his Poetics of Space, I would claim my research operates in "the domain of 
intimacy." Though the forms change from project to project, with their particular subjects and 
material engagements, I consistently return to a desire to understand and interpret the intimate 
circumstances of the everyday. This has led me to artistic explorations of the constituents of human 
identity such as language, cognition, relationships, and the body. I have built projects around 
speech recognition, mechatronic automation, physical sensing, computer vision, and machine 
learning, as these technologies increasingly shape our interactions and experience. Artistically, I 
am informed by the rich history of artists’ responses to and interventions in their own intimate 
lives.  
Theoretically, I seek to situate these diverse modes of research and production within a unified 
frame of inquiry. This chapter details the key references for my work. Investigating the 
circumstances of intimate life, my practice resonates with Bachelard's topoanalysis in analytic 
intent, psychological interest, and poetic method. In art production, I utilize strategies of site 
specific engagement and systems construction to produce art to be inhabited, informed by models 
drawn from literature, speculative fiction, and the history of art and technology. Treating

technology as both tool and subject, freighted with sociocultural meaning, my work aligns with 
Critical Engineering Design, and practices of the Bureau of Inverse Technology (Jeremijenko and 
Rich) and Machine Therapy (Dobson). 
The projects discussed in this paper build on the tradition of art to be inhabited. They are sites 
studied through constructed intervention. They seek poetic insight through technical means, 
juxtaposing mechanisms of human and machine. They pursue a psychological understanding of 
the space of everyday experience.  
2.1 
TOPOANALYSIS 
Of course, thanks to the house, a great many of our memories are 
housed… A psychoanalyst should, therefore, turn his attention to this 
simple localization of our memories. I should like to give the name of 
topoanalysis to this auxiliary of psychoanalysis. Topoanalysis, then, would 
be the systematic psychological study of the sites of our intimate lives.2 
-Gaston Bachelard 
The house, for me functions as “a simple localization” of themes, material, and technical 
possibility. It is a complex site. In his Poetics of Space, Bachelard uses the house as the structuring 
image through which he examines the poetry and psychology of intimate space. His topoanalysis, 
described above, is an apt frame for my work as an art and technology researcher: engaged in "the 
systematic psychological study of the sites of our intimate lives." Trained as a painter and engineer, 
experimental in my forms and methods, my development as an artist has been a gradual sharpening 
of focus onto these sites of intimate human experience, exploring the consequences of emerging 
technologies. Given the widespread adoption of tech into our intimate lives, a study of embedded, 
situated, “smart” technology is, for all intents and purposes, a study of intimate life. What I find

compelling in Bachelard’s work is his method combining a systematic analytic approach, 
psychological interest, anchored to real sites, with a seriousness about the significance of poetic 
imagery.  
I was introduced to Bachelard’s ideas during my MFA studies at University of California, San 
Diego, through the animation work of Carl Burton, particularly his short film Shelter that dwells 
in a Bachelardian notion of intimate, inhabited space.3 I was reintroduced to Bachelard’s ideas and 
became more invested in them as a doctoral student at the Center for Digital Arts and Experimental 
Media at the University of Washington, through discussions with my faculty Juan Pampin, Richard 
Karpen, and James Coupe. I was particularly struck by the General Exam prompt they authored 
for my colleague Ha Na Lee out of Bachelard’s Poetics of Space: "The great function of poetry is 
to give us back the situations of our dreams."4 Lee’s resultant work, Vestiges II, itself a dreamlike 
exploration of space, can be viewed online.5  
In The Poetics of Space, Bachelard takes a systematic approach to his study of intimate space. 
He takes the reader through discussions of houses, rooms, nests and shells, inhabitation, the 
dialectics of large and small, and the dialectics of within and without. These discussions are 
anchored to real sites: the home, the attic, the cellar, the living room, the cave, or the city apartment. 
For each, he analyzes those spaces as evocative sites, as locations of memories, and as images in 
particular works of poetry or art. 
Bachelard attributes a specific potency to the poetic image: “the reader of poems is asked to 
consider an image not as an object and even less as the substitute for an object, but to seize its

specific reality.”6 According to him: “By its novelty, a poetic image sets in motion the entire 
linguistic mechanism.”7 There is a radical transsubjectivity in the poetic image for Bachelard. 
Poetry supersedes language: the poet’s invented images spark a sympathetic creative genesis in 
the reader’s mind. Poems operate through “resonances and repercussions”: resonating with our life 
in the world, repercussions awakening new depths in the reader.8 “At the level of the poetic image, 
the duality of subject and object is iridescent, shimmering, unceasingly active in its inversions.”9  
Where Bachelard aims for a poetic interpretation of built space, I extend his idea of "intimate 
sites" to include any of the systems, relationships, and contexts where we find intimacy in life. For 
instance, my grandmother’s diagnosis with Alzheimer’s is explored through the creation of an 
interactive chatbot and my dialog with the system in Megahal Grandmommy.10 Similarly, an 
imaginary daughter is the conceptual machine to unpack my fantasies of parenthood in the Father-
Daughter Art Show.11 Language, drawing, and mirrored self-image are similarly addressed as 
moments of intimate exchange engaged through well-constructed art systems. On a closer reading 
of Bachelard’s work, I began to see his ideas as a natural frame for my art. I too am concerned 
with the psychological study of these intimate sites, using new computational and sensing 
techniques in a kind of technological topoanalysis.  
Significantly, Bachelard focused much of The Poetics of Space on the home as a subject. He 
describes the house as a vertical and concentrated being, and establishes a system of meanings for

spaces in the house along those axes: rationality for the roof, irrationality for the cellar.12 The house 
becomes “a tool for analysis of the human soul.”13 It is defined by its enclosure, a simple 
encapsulation of space in opposition to the surrounding nature. Its primary function is shelter, and 
its primordial form is the cave. For Bachelard the house is a kind of spatialized representation, 
creating a diagrammatic relationship between the physical arrangement of rooms and the 
psychological organization of the individual: “On whatever theoretical horizon we examine it, the 
house image would appear to have become the topography of our intimate being.”14 This casts the 
house as an intimate, psychological spatial diagram.  
2.2 
SITE SPECIFICITY 
By drawing a diagram, a ground plan of a house, a street plan to the location 
of a site, or a topographic map, one draws a "logical two dimensional 
picture." A "logical picture" differs from a natural or realistic picture in that 
it rarely looks like the thing it stands for. It is a two dimensional analogy or 
metaphor—A is Z. 
The Non-Site (an indoor earthwork) is a three dimensional logical picture 
that is abstract, yet it represents an actual site in N.J. (The Pine Barrens 
Plains). It is by this three dimensional metaphor that one site can represent 
another site which does not resemble it." 15 
- Robert Smithson 
The first major frame for my arts production is site specificity. A Machine for Living In 
establishes a descriptive relationship between observations of an actual, inhabited house site, and 
a condensed representation of that space in the gallery exhibition. As such, it is participating in the

tradition of site specific art: artists who develop work out of intense engagements with particular 
geographic and conceptual sites. Specifically, Robert Smithson’s seminal non-site artworks are a 
key model for the two-part process of this project.  
In his Nonsites, described in the passage above, Smithson establishes an abstract relationship 
between a real site and its gallery representation, the "three dimensional logical picture." He 
portrays this conceptual pairing of crafted object and observed site as a spatial metaphor. The 
constructed site does not resemble the actual site, but describes it through some abstract process 
other than likeness.  
There is space in this definition for computational production: data driven representations are 
abstracted, derived from observation, and function through visual means beyond resemblance. The 
most powerfully operative strategy here is the idea of metaphor: "Between the actual site in the 
Pine Barrens and The Non-Site itself exists a space of metaphoric significance.” Rather than poetic 
metaphor, Smithson argues for “’an entirely new sense of metaphor’ free of natural or realistic 
expressive content."16 In Figure 2.1 we see this abstract mapping between the aerial map of Pine 
Barrens and the constructed sculpture in the gallery space. Rather than working with conventional 
visual metaphors, he establishes a new aesthetic vocabulary inspired by science fiction, 
photography, and born out of the administrative aesthetic of conceptual art.17

Figure 2.1. Robert Smithson A Nonsite, Pine Barrens, New Jersey18 
In non-sites such as the Pine Barrens, Smithson focused on collapsing space and distance 
through his representations of remote sites. However, Smithson was also interested in the 
ontological categories of place and their semantic meanings. His text Untitled (Site Data) is "an 
attempt to locate structural meanings by observing building sites within a kind of abstract 
anthropology."19 Spaces discussed include the urban apartment, the artist's studio or loft, the 
suburban house, the art gallery (since the late 50s), the art museum (modern), the urban office 
building, and the industrial site (dams and spillways, power plants, flood control and irrigation 
works, tunnels bridges roads and parking lots, and air terminals). Work with that last category—
industrial sites—became his most well-known subject, as in Monuments of Passaic, where he 
brings an archeologist’s interest to them as ruins of modern society.20 Untitled (Site Data) is an

inventory of places and their meanings. I find Smithson’s descriptions entirely charged with 
potential, as spaces for action or production. 
Georges Perec accomplishes a similar structural reading of space through more diverse textual 
strategies in his Species of Spaces.21 In a slow zoom out, he travels from the page, to the bed, the 
bedroom, the apartment, the apartment building, the street, the neighborhood, the town, the 
countryside, the country, Europe, the world, and Space. With Perec there is no deferred artistic 
production and no future site-specific artwork: the text is the work. 
My work embraces an expanded notion of site specificity. Where Smithson deal with 
concrete, geographical sites, in my work I am interested in Bachelardian sites: broadened from 
concrete locations to abstract loci of content and meaning. Family as a site of drama. Studio as a 
site of creative work. Sites are concrete nuclei of meaning whether spatial, psychological, or 
cultural. 
2.3 
SYSTEMS CONSTRUCTION 
Conceptual focus rather than material limits define the system. Thus any 
situation, either in or outside the context of art, may be designed and judged 
as a system.22 
–Jack Burnham 
The second major frame for my art production is systems construction. In 1950 Ludwig von 
Bertalanffy outlined his General Systems Theory, a science of wholes, studying "systems of 
various orders not understandable by investigation of their respective parts in isolation."23 He

Books, 1999).

distinguishes between two types of systems: "open" and "closed" depending on whether they admit 
energy and material from their environments or stand apart in isolation. Once, systems thinking 
was the purview of military scientists and academic specialists, but today systems have become a 
commonplace frame for understanding any complex, multicomponent circuits of communication 
and exchange. 
In 1968, sculptor and critic Jack Burnham published “Systems Esthetics” in Artforum. In that 
article, he proposes systems thinking as the dominant paradigm of the time, articulating a societal 
transition "from an object-oriented to a systems-oriented culture.”24 This claim is more 
complicated today, as we seem suspended somewhere between the two. Increasingly we imbue 
our objects with agency, perception, and intelligent response through computational technologies. 
Smart, internet-connected things function as both. 
Burnham situated contemporaneous art practices in relation to those systems theories, 
articulating a precedence for systems over objects: "art does not reside in material entities, but in 
relations between people and between people and the components of their environment."25 From 
these new theories grew new conceptions of the artist’s role as “a perspectivist considering goals, 
boundaries, structure, input, output, and related activity inside and outside the system.”26 
Contemporary artists, cognizant of the network of possible contexts, communities, and information 
channels for their work, adopt similar global systems perspectives on the function of their work. 
Burnham engaged a broad scope of sites through his systems analyses, concerned with “the 
creation of stable, on-going relationships between organic and non-organic systems, be these 
neighborhoods, industrial complexes, farms, transportation systems, information centers,

recreational centers, or any of the other matrixes of human activity."27 The house functions as one 
such “matrix of activity,” and is particularly dense in numbers of human and non-human agents, 
relationships in motion, and layers of material accretion.  
Beyond the construction of pure, functional technologies, there is a rich ecosystem of possible 
forms at the periphery of systems art. I’m most interested in applying systems paradigms to 
interpret these non-technological sites: installation artworks as networks of signifying objects, as 
narrative systems and linguistic systems; cybernetics and systems perspectives on artist-object-
viewer relationships; ways to situate non-technical, non-canonical Systems Artists who engage 
with complex human phenomena.  
What would a non-technological systems art look like? For instance, consider Mary Kelly's 
Post-Partum Document (1973-79)28 as a work of systems art, portraying the first years of her 
child’s life as a complex psychological, familial, and linguistic system. What is a systems art 
engaged with the real, lived conditions of human experience in all of its messy materiality? My 
work explores multiple parallel systems strata: both complex functional technologies and the soft 
human structures they engage with.  
Mary Kelly’s Post-Partum Document (Figure 2.2) is an analysis of parenthood / child rearing 
as a systems of communication and exchange. It explores layers of consumption and waste (“dirty 
nappies”), language and communication, and psychoanalytic theories of child development 
through lived experience as a parent. The resulting artwork is also a configurable network: a 
signifying system of objects, images, and text that can be reconfigured to adapt to exhibition

scenarios and alternate print media form. Kelly’s book “Post-Partum Document”29 adapts and 
expands upon the project through multiple additional channels of communication. She writes 
supplementary text, reframes images, and establishes a new textual ordering of the materials 
produced through the project. Post-Partum Document becomes a diffuse cluster of activities, a 
system of meaning, producing diverse experiential artifacts.  
 
 
 
Figure 2.2. Mary Kelly Post-Partum Document 
Mary Kelly’s project is a personal inventory of intimate experience, assisted by the child as 
catalyst and anchoring subject. Birth and parenting provide frames to examine theories of 
language, development, psychoanalysis. Simultaneously, the project is a means to document 
intimate life. Where the child is Kelly’s device and conceptual lens, for me the machine is other.

CRITICAL ENGINEERING DESIGN 
The significant artist strives to reduce the technical and psychical distance 
between his artistic output and the productive means of society.30

16 
The third frame for my work is critical engineering design: practitioners who create work to 
use and interpret new technologies. As Burnham describes above, there is a currency in engaging 
technically and psychically with “the productive means of society.” These critical engineering 
practices capitalize on the capabilities of new technologies, but simultaneously reveal their limits 
and human consequences. This is part of critical, cultural sense-making — provoking informed 
perspectives on the uses, meanings, and transformative potential of new technologies.  
Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby popularized the term Critical Design in the late 90s, first 
using the phrase in their book Hertzian Tales. Critical Design encompasses a number of practices 
that “use design as a medium to stimulate discussion and debate ... about the social, cultural, and 
ethical implications of existing and emerging technologies.”31 Speculative designs “challenge 
narrow assumptions, preconceptions and givens about the role products play in everyday life.”32 
In part, this is a bid for cultural and technical relevance, “significance” as Burnham describes it 
above. Critical Design is “one of the many mutations design is undergoing in an effort to remain 
relevant to the complex technological, political, economic and social changes we are experiencing 
at the beginning of the 21c.”33 Dunne and Raby invest in the central importance of designed 
products as mass media and consumer interfaces, imbuing product design with the criticality of 
other avant-garde cultural practices. 
Oliver, Savičić, and Vasiliev provide a technologically focused update to Critical Design in 
2011 with their Critical Engineering Manifesto. “The Critical Engineer considers Engineering to 
be the most transformative language of our time, shaping the way we move, communicate and

think. It is the work of the Critical Engineer to study and exploit this language, exposing its 
influence.”34 This belief in the centrality of engineering in determining sociocultural behavior and 
values is shared with the next practice I discuss in detail: The Bureau of Inverse Technology. Where 
Critical Engineering differs is in expressing a skeptical and somewhat paranoid worldview. In 
addition to the need for technological literacy, they speak of the “challenge and threat” of 
technological dependence, a desire to “incite suspicion,” “exposing influence” and “moments of 
imbalance and deception.”35 This is a language of resistance to power, exposing hidden 
mechanisms of control, and the user constraints built into the formal strictures of engineered 
design. 
The authors identify a reciprocality in the constitution of engineering and its subjects: “each 
work of engineering engineers its user.” I identify a similar reciprocality in the knowledge gained 
through my experimental human-computer interactions: they effect a reciprocal diagnosis of 
human and machine where we learn something about each. In terms of practical medium, the 
critical engineers seek to observe and operate in “the space between the production and the 
consumption of technology,” adopting strategies from “art, architecture, activism, philosophy and 
invention.”36 
Finally, Critical Engineering arrives at a systems perspective: “The Critical Engineer expands 
‘machine’ to describe interrelationships encompassing devices, bodies, agents, forces and 
networks.” This generalization of the category of machine is one Le Corbusier makes implicitly 
though his mechanized theories of architecture, one I adopt in my own work and research, and

serves to connect Critical Engineering practice to the long discourse and heritage of the machine 
in industry and culture.  
2.4.1 Inverse Technologies 
Natalie Jeremijenko and Kate Rich’s Bureau of Inverse Technology (BIT) bills itself as "an 
information agency servicing the Information Age."37 Their reflexive approach turns the products 
of technical innovation to examine the systems and structures that produced them. As I see it, the 
practice has three key ideas: that data has values (particularly in what is and isn’t measured), that 
artists and designers importantly render things legible, and that cultural producers operate both 
through experimental prototyping and mediagenic spectacle.  
Their project Suicide Box (1996) demonstrates these strategies.38 This was an autonomous 
computer vision system monitoring the Golden Gate bridge, at the time the most common site for 
suicide attempts in the Bay Area and the country. Installed on site with a view of the bridge, the 
system looks for vertical motion in a camera feed and records those events to disk, creating “public, 
frame-accurate data of a social phenomenon not previously accurately quantified.”39 This project 
raises questions of what information counts, what we choose to observe, and what jobs we task 
our technologies with. Site specific and locally engaged, this project complicates our 
understanding of the context and culture of San Francisco and the Bay Area as “Information capital 
and Suicide capital of the USA.”40 Additionally, the piece makes corporations involuntarily

Figure 2.3. Bureau of Inverse Technology, Suicide Box (1996) 
Through the corresponding video produced about the project (and later exhibited), BIT 
renders visible the issue of suicide, questions the social and governmental response to this known 
problem, and conveys some of the complicated ethical terrain underlying the creation and 
deployment of advanced technologies. The video of the project (and indeed videos of other BIT 
related projects) exists as a mass media communication that can circulate widely. While a smart 
use of media technology and a clever manipulation of the conventions of mass commercial 
communication, my critique of BITs methods has to do with what I consider an experientially 
impoverished result for the viewer. It’s all about the corporation, the technological apparatus, and 
a critical examination of the forces “out there.” The work’s cold, technical surface cuts it off from 
the domain of intimacy. But perhaps that is the point. 
I am interested in using similar techniques to related ends: achieving a reciprocal diagnosis 
that examines the nature of the human as well as the nature of the machine, and how they construct 
one another.  
 
 
20 
If BIT was the appropriate pseudo-corporate entity to service the information age, what is the 
necessary entity to service ours? Jeremijenko now operates the Environmental Health Clinic,41 
providing prescriptions for improving our wellness (and the planet’s), developing mutualistic 
systems engaged with our ecological environment. I believe there is still a need for inverse 
technologies: we are living through a second machine age built on machine perception and 
machine learning, defined by these new applications of computational technology. 
I will end with some provocation from Natalie Jeremijenko on the relation between art and 
technoscience, New York Magazine from 2000:  
The art world is a very prissy little thing over in the corner, while the major 
cultural forces are being determined by technoscience. The whole way we 
imagine ourselves is being redefined, and the art world is still talking about 
gender politics or whatever without taking on big corporate biotechnical 
advances. Technology is a language that is much less about privilege, it's 
much less intimidating conceptually than art criticism–one knows how to 
use a computer keyboard.42  
2.4.2 Machine Therapy 
A more intimate approach to critical engineering, Kelly Dobson's Machine Therapy is a 
“parapraxis of machine design,” creating connections with machines through their visceral side-
effects "in ways that are revelatory and potentially therapeutic for people."43 In Machine Therapy, 
"it is not the main functions that the machines are designed to carry out that matter most, but rather 
it is the side elements of their designs and actions that matter to people in deep yet unconscious

ways."44 A hybrid art and technology practice, Dobson's work is visceral, psychological, and 
potentially therapeutic. It is also acutely personal. Dobson frames her practice as arising from 
personal experiences communing with industrial machines. 
Like Bachelard, Dobson's work is inherently psychological. Invoking therapy, she suggests 
that one or both parties (human and machine) is in need of a cure. This relates to my own idea of 
reciprocal diagnosis of human and machine: that through unexpected encounters we reveal 
something about the nature of each. In 2005, Dobson conducted a series of “Machine Therapy 
Sessions” with her interactive devices and documented participants’ responses to their 
experience.45 Many sought to prolong their engagements, and found near-total immersion in their 
experience.  
Dobson’s projects focus on “visceral, cathartic, and reflexive expressions and 
communication”.46 Rather than denying the sonic, haptic, and visual qualities of machines, she 
connects them to processes of human expression. For instance, Blendie is “a modified mid-1940’s 
Osterizer blender that foregrounds the guttural sounds of a blender in action.”47 Blendie analyzes 
sound with its embedded microphone and signal processor to detect human vocalizations matching 
its own “guttural” blender voice. It uses the dominant pitch of the user’s voice to modulate the 
speed of its motor, creating a sympathetic re-embodiment and establishing a visceral empathy.

Figure 2.4. Kelly Dobson, Blendie (2004) 
This dynamic of human-computer interaction relates to the contemporary practice of visceral 
design, producing situated, embodied experience of immaterial data. In Luke Stark’s article “Come 
on Feel the Data (and Smell It)", he finds that “users prompted to engage viscerally will have a 
well-rounded sense of their own intellectual, emotional and physical stance on the matter at 
hand."48 A visceral engagement draws on the full range of sensory perception, rather than 
privileging dominant channels of visual and auditory experience.  
Visceral engagement places users in an intimate, embodied position. This focus on the body 
of both human and machine agents is a strong counterpoint to the rhetoric and design choices 
expressed through Le Corbusier’s modernist practice, particularly works such as Villa Savoye, his 
flagship modernist “machine for living.”49 As she describes it, a “parapraxis”, Dobson’s work 
dwells in the “slip of the tongue, thought to reveal a repressed motive.”50 In psychoanalysis this is

unscriptable human subject. 
2.5 
ART TO BE INHABITED 
The function of inhabiting constitutes the link between full and empty. A 
living creature fills an empty refuge, images inhabit, and all corners are 
haunted, if not inhabited.51 
 
A house that has been experienced is not an inert box. Inhabited space 
transcends geometrical space.52 
-Gaston Bachelard 
A Machine for Living In belongs to a tradition of art to be inhabited. These are projects that 
take a hybrid approach to their subjects as sites and systems. They occupy real spaces, whether 
architectural or psychological. They enact a Bachelardian notion of site-specificity. Whether 
examining existing sites (Oldenburg’s lower east side bodega) or manufacturing new ones (Lynn 
Hershman Leeson’s invented Roberta Breitmore persona), they confuse the distinction between 
simulation and the real. Invariably, as work both constructed and inhabited by the artists, they are 
personally psychological topoanalytic studies of intimate space. They are also diffuse projects 
functioning as systems, not objects. 
Lynn Hershman Leeson’s Roberta Breitmore project (Figure 2.50) began in 1973 with her 
arrival in San Francisco, taking up residency at the Dante Hotel.53 Over the next 5 years, she 
developed an alternate persona named Roberta Breitmore. Strategies included renting a room, 
registering for a driver’s license, signing up for bank accounts, and developing palettes for clothing

and makeup choices. Additionally, she advertised for roommates, went on dates, visited a therapist, 
and at one point hired a private detective to document her daily activities, providing consequential 
“proof” of this new persona. Later she multiplied this performative identity, hiring multiple actors 
to inhabit the role for particular events, art openings, etc. Leeson’s work tweaks the mechanisms 
of institutionally constituted identity (driver’s license, therapist sessions, newspaper want-ads) and 
thus critically engages the real social systems supporting personal identity. Simultaneously these 
gestures pursue a personal exploration and fantastic play. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.5. Lynn Hershman Leeson, Roberta Breitmore (1973-1978) 
Claes Oldenburg’s Store similarly blurs the boundaries between the representation and the 
real. Originally proposed to his gallery as a commercial artistic enterprise, 54 Oldenburg occupied 
a store front on the Lower East Side of Manhattan for 2 months in 1961. His Store, in a commercial 
storefront, would in fact operate as a store:  
In the front half, it is my intention to create the environment of a store, by 
painting and placing (hanging, projecting, lying) objects after the spirit and 
in the form of popular objects of merchandise, such as may be seen in stores 
                                                
54 See “The Store Described & Budget for the Store” in Claes Oldenburg and Emmett Williams, 
Store Days: Documents from The Store, 1961, and Ray Gun Theater, 1962 (New York: 
Something Else Press, 1967).  
 
 
25 
and store-windows of the city, especially in the area where the store is 
(Clinton St., f.ex., Delancey St., 14th St.).55 
Functionally, this piece constructs and inhabits an essentially ambiguous place between 
reality and representation. His initial proposal included an estimate of costs including rent, 
renovations, and materials for art production, as well as expected operating hours, public events, 
etc.56 His “Preliminary Report on the Store” tallies total sales, tax collected, cost of rent, utilities, 
and supplies, and calculates profits and costs to split between Oldenburg and his gallery.57 This 
project both constructs a site and inhabits an existing one: a doubling of roles and representations, 
creating a pseudo-commercial doppelganger gallery mimicking its commercial brethren. 
 
 
Figure 2.6. Claes Oldenburg, The Store (1961) 
Near the end of his life, between 1819 and 1823, Francisco de Goya painted a set of darkly 
compelling images on the walls of his house near Madrid, the “Quinta del Sordo” (Villa of the 
Deaf Man). Though his home named after a previous occupant, Goya, too, was deaf and nearly

blind when he moved into the house, having recovered from a bout of near fatal illness.58 
Colloquially known as the Black Paintings, and dark in both subject matter and tone (reflecting 
the circumstances of his personal health), these works are a particularly private example of art to 
be inhabited. There are fourteen paintings in all, seven each in two rooms, one on each floor of the 
house. These were painted directly onto the walls of the house, and were never intended to travel 
or be exhibited. Goya did not discuss the works during his lifetime, thus titles and dates are mere 
speculation. They only rose to widespread public knowledge nearly fifty years after his death, in 
1873-74, when they were transferred to canvas and relocated to the Museo del Prado in Madrid. 
This is a rare case of a major work by a major artist serving largely private functions during the 
course of his life, when there was any chance of getting direct explanation.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.7. Francisco de Goya, Black Paintings (1819-1823) 
Goya literally surrounded himself with his painted images. Each of two rooms in the house 
had paintings mounted on all available wall space. Photographer Jean Laurent documented these 
images in situ prior to their relocation to the Prado. In his photographs of the works (for instance 
Figure 2.8 below) you see the wall paper, wainscoting, and decorative wooden trim of the

architecture of the home. What accounts for this directness of gesture, and this construction of 
immersive pictorial space to reside in? Interpretations of the work tend towards the 
autobiographical, reading preoccupations with aging and mortality in the work, as well as Goya’s 
habitual themes of superstition, organized religion, and the power of the mob. Since he did not 
discuss them in his lifetime, all readings are mere speculation. The only thing known for sure is 
that these images serve some private symbolic and expressive function for the artist, that he chose 
to paint them directly in the intimate lived space of his everyday life.

Goya constructed an image space to literally dwell within. This is similar to Hershman 
Leeson’s invention of the Breitmore persona to inhabit, and Oldenburg’s creation of the Store to 
operate as both proprietor and artist/craftsman. All of the projects construct ontologically 
ambiguous sites straddling self-consciously artistic production and everyday contexts, roles, and 
activities. My own works pursue a similar strategy of construction and inhabitation. They are 
machines for living, intimate psychological spaces to be inhabited, operated by human and 
machine.

Chapter 3. STRATEGIES AND EXPLORATIONS 
This chapter outlines the creative strategies and technical terrain for my research through early 
projects leading to A Machine for Living In. I describe my technical domains of engagement. I 
highlight the essential sites of meaning explored. I describe the formal strategies operating in the 
work and the particular systems constructed. Finally, I consider these projects as examples of 
introspective inquiry into human and machine. Each project deals with different modes of 
technologically mediated human experience.  
3.1 
TECHNICAL DOMAIN 
I work in a diverse landscape of contemporary electronic technologies, grouped under topics 
of physical computing, creative coding, and experimental human computer interaction. My early 
digital projects targeted single technologies for exploration and use: for example, automatic speech 
recognition in the project Solipsist,60 conversational chatbots in Megahal Grandmommy,61 and face 
recognition in Everyone as Someone I Know.62  
Recent projects combine multiple modes of technical production in service of larger 
descriptive goals. Searle’s Room (and the follow up, The Serious Business of Children) used a 
                                                
60 Solipsist used the Carnegie Melon University speech recognition framework pocketsphinx.

62 The early version of this project used a simple Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm 
to match viewer’s faces with static images in a database. The newer version, shown as “Face 
Swap”, tracks viewers faces in live video using a constrained linear model (CLM) based on 
facial landmarks written by Jason Saragih, implemented in the ofxFaceTracker package: Kyle

mechatronic drawing machine, motion encoders, k-means clustering, concatenative synthesis, and 
speech recognition to explore machine intelligence through children’s protolanguage.63 Rover used 
a mechatronic camera platform, structure from motion algorithms, light field synthesis / 
computational photography techniques, GLSL shaders, audio feature extraction, clustering, and 
granular synthesis to create a dreamlike cinematic exploration of place.64 My dissertation project 
continues in this vein of multi-process research and development. Each of these has been in a sense 
a “machines for living.”  
My material engagements are these technologies of the self: domains where technologies 
purport to represent or capture the constituents of identity. These include receptive technologies 
for machine perception of sound, vision, speech and language. They also include expressive 
synthesis of human legible sound, image, drawing, speech and language. Other topics deal with 
digital fabrication, embodied experience, computational portraiture, and personal analytics. 
These domains stake a terrain of machine living, our contemporary condition where 
computers are the machines we dwell in and amongst. The bulk of contemporary experience is 
mediated through electronic media and computational sensing technologies. Thus, my work with 
them is an attempt at a critical embrace of Burnham’s “productive means of society.” Projects that 
engage the conditions of machine living are the meeting point between critical engineering design 
practice, technological topoanalysis, and psychological investigation.

My affinity for technology is rooted in my own history as an artist and engineer. I started 
programming in MS Basic some time in elementary school, and taught myself C++ when I was 
13. I have built circuits for as long as I can remember, starting with the Radio Shack electronics 
inventors kit my grandma gave me, also during elementary school. I designed and programmed 
my first embedded microcontrollers and fabricated and populated my first printed circuit boards 
in high school. I have a deep technical and intellectual affinity for these techniques and modes of 
production. It is only in my mature career as an artist that I have situated them in a unified 
conceptual field with other more traditional artistic media and content concerns.65 
3.2 
SITES OF MEANING 
Beyond technical exploration, my projects are structured around particular human 
engagements. Specific subjects vary from project to project, but as described in the previous 
chapter, they are unified in their engagement with sites of everyday life. A partial list of previous 
subjects for my work includes Alzheimer’s disease, parenthood, guns, drawing, speech, language, 
studio practice, art school, family members, and art world heroes.  
These spring from a conceptual extension of Bachelard’s “sites of intimate life”: similarly 
drawn from the domain of the intimate; equally poetic and replete with history, memory, and 
imagination; but broader than mere geometric space. Some are actual temporospatial sites (the 
home, the studio, the art school). Others are social relations, kinships, or common cultural 
experiences. All of these are defined by some readily identifiable and simply articulated nucleus 
                                                
65 Not to say that I am not adapting to an emergent technological landscape: in recent work and 
instruction I have employed digital fabrication, cloud-based computing, embedded systems, 
machine learning, and GPU programming. Future horizons for my work include neural and 
somatic interfaces, augmented reality, and autonomous robotics.  
 
 
 
32 
or locus of meaning. My work is anchored to the experience of the everyday, through these 
commonplace subjects, and thus readily accessible.  
3.3 
FORMAL STRATEGIES 
My work develops a number of formal strategies. The first, model-limited experience, has to 
do with the functional expression and constructed experience of the inherent limits of algorithms 
and data as filters for experience. The next, opportunistic systems, are the active counterparts to 
the first: systems that act to achieve desired results rather than passively filtering the world. The 
next, machine observers and digital surrogates, substitute machine perception and autonomous 
agents as placeholders for absent others in traditionally human roles. Finally, the idea of the 
machine as metaphor reframes the stakes of these previous strategies to focus on meta-practices 
of representation and analogy between human and machine.  
3.3.1 Model-Limited Experience 
Model-limited experiences are interactions where participant experience is curtailed (and 
potentially frustrated) by the algorithmic parameters and implicit values in the data producing that 
experience. These systems are designed to give viewers direct, working understanding of 
algorithmically inbuilt rules of interaction; prompting reflection on the nature of those rules and 
values.  
My project Solipsist exemplifies this dynamic.66 In it, a small wooden room with a 
microphone and receipt printer establishes a finite world of language. Speaking to the “intelligent” 
printer that transcribes their words, viewers quickly learn that the system (and its choice of 
                                                
66 Robert Twomey, Solipsist, 2011; available from http://roberttwomey.com/solipsist. 
 
 
 
33 
language model) directly determines what is heard, what counts, and thus what can be said. The 
system’s values determine the space of expression. Poetically, this illuminates the inherent 
boundedness of our contemporary reality of always-on speech recognition, and resonates with the 
idea of language as a closed system. These lessons project outwards to inform our understandings 
of the parameters of commercially available personal voice assistants.67 This also resonates with 
the essential Jeremijenko/BIT interest in the idea “that data has values,” and that a task of the artist 
is the render them legible. 
 
 
 
Figure 3.1. Solipsist (2011) 
Solipsist was born out of a close reading of Mel Bochner’s “Serial Art, Systems, Solipsism.”68 
In it, he invokes the character of the solipsist to describe the aesthetic characteristics of a number 
of contemporary art practices, circa 1967: 
                                                
67 Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, and Google’s eponymous Google Assistant. 
 68Mel Bochner, "Serial Art, Systems, Solipsism," Arts Magazine, no. Summer (1967). 
 
 
34 
For the solipsist reality is not enough. He denies the existence of anything 
outside the self-enclosed confines of his own mind. Viewed within the 
boundaries of thought, the random dimensions of reality lose their qualities 
of extension. They become flat and static. Serial art in its highly abstract 
and ordered manipulation of thought is likewise self-contained and 
nonreferential.69  
There are two moves at play in this passage: a flattening of reality through the boundaries of 
thought (as language), and a declaration of self-containment and nonreferentiality. These same 
formal principles operate in my piece: a flattening of experience into language, and the 
development of a self-contained, closed system of speech. Viewers of the piece are situated in an 
isolated, closed world of language.  
The second reference for this piece is David Markson’s novel Wittgenstein’s Mistress.70 In it, 
the protagonist, Kate, is similarly suspended in a finite space of language. This enclosure is 
compounded by a seemingly finite well of experience, historical reference, and language that she 
cycles through in the book. In the form of the book, a printed textual medium, the reader and author 
similarly have no recourse to reference or information outside of the text.  
Each of these creative works functions as a model-limited experience and finite system, where 
the rules of the game establish the space of possible interaction and expression. The character of 
these systems is strangely flat and unexpressive. As Bochner describes: 
Some may say, and justifiably, that there is a "poetry" or "power" or some 
other quality to this work that an approach like the above misses. But 
aspects like those exist for individuals and are difficult to communicate 
using conventional meanings for words. Others may claim that given this 
they are still bored. If this is the case, their boredom may be the product of

Archive Press, 1988).

being forced to view things not as sacred but as they probably are—
autonomous and indifferent.71 
3.3.2 Opportunistic Systems and Projective Identity 
While similarly finite in their data and rule sets, opportunistic or coercive systems act on their 
environment to produce desired goals. Here, beyond simply expressing the limits of data and 
algorithms, systems proactively author their intended effects on the external world. 
In my project Everyone as Someone I Know, viewers’ video mediated bodies are the contexts 
on which the system manifests a database of stored personae, grafting pre-computed identities in 
place of the viewers’ own faces.72 Functionally, this system excises and re-edits identity through 
facial appearance, expression, mouths and words. Representational effect is no longer due to 
viewer’s volitional contribution to an interactive experience, but rather to an involuntary re-edit of 
their identity through computer vision and face tracking technology.  
This project speaks to the mechanics of computational attribution of identity as broadly 
practiced by computing giants such as Google and Facebook, and dwells in potentially sinister 
consequences of voluntary or semi-voluntary participation in these systems. Who oversees or 
verifies these computational judgments? This is a pressing contemporary issue in machine learning 
and computer vision communities, with a growing public focus on the bias built into naturalistic 
recognition and perception technologies.73

Figure 3.2. Face Swap / Everyone as Someone I Know (2013) 
In audiovisual content, this project explores ideas of public/private personae and interpersonal 
desire. The faces and identities programmed into the system, stored in its database, were pre-
selected by the artist based on entirely personal criteria of attachment and desire, appropriating 
identity irrespective of actual social distance. The bulk of the “characters” in the piece are artists 
or theorists that the artist feels particularly attached to. Examples include William Pope.L, Marina 
Abramovic, Marcel Duchamp, and Rosalind Krauss. In this sense, the project becomes a sort of 
aspirational wish fulfillment: a system for projective identity using advanced computational 
techniques to instantiate idealized others through the presence of viewer/participants.  
This project collapsed boundaries of space, time, and context, unifying a collection of absent 
others based on their value to some esoteric individual fantasy. It is solipsistic, in its own way.  
3.3.3 Digital Surrogates 
A third major artistic strategy in my work is the creation of digital surrogates. Similar to the 
dynamics at play in the model-limited and opportunistic systems described above, observers and 
surrogates differ through their relative passivity and agency. 
 
 
37 
Much of my work (including pre-digital projects such as The Father-Daughter Art Show74) 
operates through the construction of affective surrogates. In engineering research and consumer 
product design, attention has been devoted to efforts such as affective computing,75 social 
robotics,76 and companion robots.77 These are systems that capitalize on the inbuilt human abilities 
to sense and express emotions, harnessing those capabilities through expressive and receptive 
machine perception techniques. Kelly Dobson’s Machine Therapy projects (discussed in Chapter 
2), offer a unique perspective on affective computing focusing on embodied, visceral interactions, 
but still concerned with the reception and expression of human-legible emotion. 
Working from the position of a studio artist, I take a broad view of affective surrogacy. 
Machines or computational systems can be surrogates, but so can objects. A surrogate is anything 
that stands in as place-holder or invented foil. They function variously as observers, translators, 
interlocutors, partners, replicas, doppelgangers, or simulations. For example, The Father-
Daughter Art Show (2007) is a body of work built around the idea of an imaginary child.78 This 
conceptual device was a mechanism to explore fantasies of parenthood and family absent any real

child. The works produced were crafted studio objects (paintings, drawings, sculpture) and video 
art, functioning as an expressive system in an art installation: an object-based visual essay.

In a digital project such as Megahal Grandmommy,79 the constructed system (a text-based 
chatbot) was a direct replacement for a living individual: my grandmother, recently diagnosed with 
Alzheimer’s disease. Conversations with the chatbot potentially displaced or replaced 
conversations with my actual grandmother, and the whole system became an affective 
psychological feedback loop. My interactions with the surrogate, contextualized through actual 
events, generated a unique meditation on and portrait of my grandmother’s declining mental state.

Figure 3.4. Megahal Grandmommy (2005) 
Surrogates operate through this displacement of affection of attachment onto the constructed 
other. From an artistic perspective, surrogates serve as a third agent/actor, triangulating meaning 
between artist, viewer, and crafted object. The artist interacts with the crafted surrogate, and the 
viewer interacts with that same construction with some additional comprehension of the artist’s 
use and history.  
From a cybernetic perspective, surrogates serve as psychological feedback devices, catalyzing 
emotion or interaction. Dobson conceived of Blendie and her later projects Umo, Omo, and Amo80 
in this sense: as cathartic and therapeutic on an emotional, visceral, bodily level. This is a frontier 
for engineering design: creating affective devices that sense and respond to emotional expression. 
My own projects pursue poetic aims through similarly psychological / topoanalytic engagement. 
Increasingly, personal robots such as Cynthia Breazeal’s Jibo are being adopted into intimate 
space, for instance serving as companions for children and the elderly in the home. Breazeal’s MIT 
colleague, Sherry Turkle, succinctly articulates the dangers of this approach to forming “real” 
emotional bonds with machines in her article from the Washington Post from December 2017:

These machines are seductive and offer the wrong payoff: the illusion of 
companionship without the demands of friendship, the illusion of 
connection without the reciprocity of a mutual relationship. And interacting 
with these empathy machines may get in the way of children’s ability to 
develop a capacity for empathy themselves.81 
3.3.4 Machine Observers  
Machine observers are the passive versions of active surrogates. They operate as mute 
witnesses and narrators, sensing and describing aspects of observed experience. Solipsist, Convex 
Mirror,82 and Rover83 all function in this vein: registering external events with no real capacity to 
influence them. Solipsist transcribes speech to text to produce machine-mediated representations 
of spoken words.  
Convex Mirror is a site-specific drawing machine and computer vision system creating 
compressed temporal representations of time and space. Substituting computer vision and 
precision automation for the human hand and eye, this project operates with a superhuman physical 
precision and temporal duration. Each drawing is produced over the course of three weeks, for 
twelve hours a day, as the system dogmatically records its computational perception, resulting in 
densely rendered images such as Figure 3.5 below. Named after Parmigianino’s self-portrait in a 
convex mirror, this project implicitly contrasts the scope, scale, and temporal duration of human 
and machine labor, producing its own portrait in the process.

DXARTS Professor Juan Pampin and James Coupe’s Sanctum84 operates as a multi-modal 
machine observer: using algorithmically extracted quantifications of viewer identity, gender, age, 
etc., as a basis to produce visual, textual, and sonic narration of the public space surrounding the 
Henry Art Gallery at the University of Washington. Embedded across the façade of the gallery 
building, the system monitors passers-by and produces a continuous social narration of place. 
Sanctum shares qualities with the opportunistic systems described above: it uses participants’ faces 
as the occasions to retrieve and synthesize textual, auditory, and sonic narrative derived from 
contributed social media material, collapsing remote and local information in the vein of a 
Smithsonian nonsite.

BIT’s Suicide Box functions as a witness or machine observer to a most psychically charged 
phenomena: suicide victims jumping from the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Here the 
muteness of the system accentuates the artistic strategy: highlighting the lack of any official

demonstrably feasible. 
Rover (a collaboration with Michael McCrea) postulates a machine explorer (like the Martian 
Rover, our project’s namesake) with its own perception and intelligence. It filters audio-visual 
experience through novel processes of machine listening and computational photography.85 After 
initially sampling a site through a mechatronic imaging system and digital audio recording, Rover

algorithmically processes and re-explores the place in a machinic search and audio-visual 
reminiscence. The result is a dreamlike exploration of place, existing somewhere between cinema 
and photography. Rover develops and explores the particular aesthetic character of machine 
perception of visual and sonic experience, playing those modes of expression off of our own 
inherent human understandings of these same quotidian spaces. 
 
 
Figure 3.7. Rover (2015) 
What is gained in substituting machine perception for human perception? Applying 
engineered models of mechanized perception, machine observers implicitly contrast their 
perceptual capabilities with those of their human analogs. The human interest in machine 
perception is in experiencing this central comparison of natural and engineered modes of 
perception, as these differences illuminate the function and meaning of our own. Biologist Jakob 
von Uexküll calls this organism-specific worldview the umwelt, the subjective perceptual 
understanding of the world defined by its sensory apparatus and cognitive capabilities.86 As we 
develop increasingly sophisticated human-like modes of computational perception, this

comparative study of human and machine offers potentially revelatory insight about the nature of 
each. 
3.3.5 Machine as Metaphor 
Machines as simple as thermostats can be said to have beliefs.87 
- John McCarthy 
The ultimate formulation of my approach to human computer interaction is the idea of the 
machine as metaphor. As John McCarthy concisely describes in his essay “Ascribing Mental 
Qualities to Machines”: machines, particularly computers, have become the preeminent vessels by 
which to examine our human cognitive nature. Even “machines as simple as thermostats can be 
said to have beliefs.”88 What McCarthy has written amounts to a literary description: using the 
device of metaphor to lever a host of human traits and qualities onto unthinking, unfeeling 
“intelligent machines.” This is projective identification writ large, an anthropomorphism of the 
dominant technology of our time.  
McCarthy’s article speaks in very narrow terms about ideas later termed Strong Artificial 
Intelligence (AI), at a point in the 1970s where the field looked very different than it does today. 
But our contemporary impulse remains the same. Machine Learning (ML) is the dominant 
technique of our time, and facile comparisons with human perception, cognition, and learning 
deserve scrutiny: to elucidate the complex relationships between computational techniques and the 
domains they model. Art is an ideal discipline to pursue this work, comprehensively addressing

the social, cultural, and experiential dimensions of ML techniques through functional aesthetic 
products.  
 
Figure 3.8. Francis Picabia, Fille Née sans Mère (1916-18) 89 
This anthropomorphism of the machine is a rich artistic tradition: Picabia attempted similar 
ends through purely visual metaphor in paintings such as Fille Neé sans Mère (Daughter Born 
Without a Mother), seen in Figure 3.8. My imaginary daughter is spiritual kin to Picabia’s 
daughter, similarly born without a mother, birthed of a generative conceptual machine. The 
opportunity, now, is to create functional machines emulating human-like cognition and 
perception—critically assessing the capabilities of these new technologies while untangling this 
complex human-machine metaphor.  
A number of my works operate in this manner: addressing pressing questions about human 
nature through computational analogs. Rather than merely assuming the validity of this central

comparison of human to machine, I always seek to question both the function and the failure of 
the metaphor.  
My project Searle’s Room90 grows out of an engagement with these computational theories 
of mind, a response to John Searle’s 1980 essay “Minds, Brains, and Programs.” In it, Searle 
challenges the claims of strong AI: that “the appropriately programmed computer literally has 
cognitive states,” and that “programs thereby explain human cognition.”91 To challenge this 
perspective, he describes what is known as the “Chinese room” thought experiment: where a 
human operator isolated in a room, by means of lookup tables and rules, responds “intelligently” 
to queries written in a foreign script they have no comprehension of. To observers on the outside, 
this black box appears to demonstrate comprehension and intelligent response. In this, Searle is 
describing the formal structure of a then state-of-the art reasoning system—with algorithmic 
hierarchies of query and response—but gives lie to the idea that such mechanisms in any way 
demonstrates intelligence. The human in the loop, capable of self-analysis and critical reflection, 
clearly has no understanding of what they do. Everything else is mere process, any “intelligence” 
is baked into the system a priori by the author of the rules and data. The project is an act of 
technological ventriloquism.

Figure 3.9. Searle’s Room (2013) 
My project Searle’s Room is a parallel construction using children’s babble and scribbles as 
protolanguage, unintelligible in any conventional linguistic sense but communicative in other 
registers. My piece casts the viewer as an observer on the outside of a linguistic query and response 
conducted in half formed baby words and scribbles. Where the observer in Searle’s experiment is 
fluent in the language of conversation and thus attributes intelligence to the room, the viewer in 
my piece is linguistically in the dark. In fact, there is no language there. Rather, viewers rely on 
more deeply human and embodied responses to pitch, tone, and the biosocial evocations of 
children’s utterances.  
Ultimately Searle’s Room becomes about the difference between expression and 
comprehension, and creates a surreal estrangement from the intimate appeal of children’s speech 
through the distancing mechanism of the robots. Technically, the apparatus is set to fail: a speech 
transcription device attempting to find language (English text) where there is none. The viewer 
sees this, creating a critical vantage point from which to evaluate the weight and authority given 
to the processes of machine translation and expression.  
 
 
48 
My piece, like Searle’s essay, is a reflection on the impossibility of autonomy in any 
technological artifact. It advances the idea that “intelligent” behavior has always been programmed 
in. (Today, trained in, through epochs of machine learning) This returns to Kelly Dobson’s 
question of “what we interact with when we interact with machines.”92 I would argue that in most 
of our supposedly intelligent or autonomous creations, we are interacting with the consciousness, 
subjectivity, and intent of whomever constructed it. This is a kind of high-tech ventriloquism: the 
time-delayed manifestation of behavioral rules or data biases built by the human engineer behind 
the screen. The device becomes just a longer stick to paint with.

ARRIVING AT HOME 
There is ground for taking the house as a tool for analysis of the human 
soul.93  
- Gaston Bachelard 
Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?94 
- Richard Hamilton 
My search for a dissertation topic was driven, like much of my creative work, by the twin 
forces of dissatisfaction and desire. My previous projects seemed too narrow: whether in their 
singular focus on individual technologies, or in their bracketing off of narrow ranges of human 
experience (children’s language, drawing, etc.) as conceptual scenario. For my dissertation I 
sought a subject that would provide a more expansive field for engagement, encompassing a broad 
range of technical inquiry and human experience. Rather than picking bit by bit at individual 
threads of technical and humanistic inquiry, I wanted an encompassing site where the project could 
be as much about weaving a tapestry as developing the individual threads. This is a compositional 
challenge. 
Home is a generous subject. It is a complex and layered space of multiple modes of being and 
experience. We are our most bodily at home, where we sleep, eat, bathe, and eliminate. Home is a 
space of shared language: the site of ongoing dialog and exchange between inhabitants, guests,

and tele-present others; people and animals; people and objects (including voice-responsive smart 
assistants). Reductively, home can be viewed as a series of discrete physical interactions between 
inhabitants and the doors, cabinets, objects and appliances within.95 Geometrically, home is a fixed 
spatial envelope, a space of encapsulated living defined by its separation from the world around it, 
recalling Bachelard’s concept of the cave as the mother of all homes, and the minimal inhabited 
space. Most importantly, home is an intimate space, replete with history, memory, fantasy, and 
quotidian narrative. 
The home as a subject is too broad for a single comprehensive art historical survey. As 
Bachelard says: “our house is our corner of the world... it is our first universe, a real cosmos in 
every sense of the word.” It is our first site of common human experience. Artists have variously 
wrapped the home,96 split it,97 shelled it,98 burnt it,99 and rebuilt it.100 While thoroughly explored 
as an artistic subject, I believe that conversely, the home is impossible to exhaust.

What is unique about today’s homes? The major transformation of domestic space in the past 
twenty-plus years is the penetration of technology into the inner sanctum of the home. 
Commercially, this is sold as the smart home. 
The term smart home first surfaced in 1995, when the American Home Builders Associate 
established a special interest group on “Smart Homes.”102 While early smart home development 
focused on integrating the multiple control systems and technical layers of the home, it is only in

the early 2000s that the computational smart home as we understand it arose. This is the period in 
which the science fictional became the nearly possible. Commercial markets are now saturated 
with competing smart hubs (Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple HomePod), communication 
protocols (ZigBee, Thread, Z-Wave and more), and novel technological solutions in search of a 
problem (smart kitchen stove knobs, smart button pushing robots, smart door cameras). Financial 
forecasters estimate the smart home sector will grow from a $24.1 billion market in 2016 to $54.3 
billion by 2022.103

For my purposes, the smart home is a target of opportunity: it marries my complex interest in 
the home as a site and subject with the kinds of technologies I seek to examine through my work. 
Previously I have used speech recognition to explore language as a closed system, computer vision 
to create machinic attribution of identity, and physical sensors to capture and re-animate biological 
motion. The notional smart home gathers all of these machine perception and computational 
sensing technologies into a single space of ubiquitous, multi-modal machine observation: smart 
assistants always listening, smart cameras interpreting domestic activity, and wireless sensors 
monitoring all aspects of inhabited space. 
My arrival at the home as a subject for the dissertation is a blend of artistic fascination with 
the home, a personal desire to interpret intimate life, and a critical opportunity to examine an 
emergent space of technological invention, the smart home.  
4.2 
LE CORBUSIER AND MACHINE LIVING 
The problem of the house has not yet been stated.  
Nevertheless, there do exist standards for the dwelling house.  
Machinery contains in itself the factor of economy, which makes for 
selection.  
The house is a machine for living in.105 
—Le Corbusier 
Having settled on the home as a site and subject, I needed a frame through which to develop 
the project. I found it in the work of Modernist French-Swiss architect Charles-Èdouard Jeanneret, 
known as Le Corbusier. In his 1923 book Vers une Architecture (Towards a New Architecture), 
from which the above passage is sourced, he embraces the machine as a model and engineering as 
the muse for the design and construction of buildings. For Le Corbusier, the epochal “problem of 
                                                
105 Le Corbusier, Towards a New Architecture (New York: Dover Publications, 1986), 4. 
 
 
54 
the house” (circa 1923) could be addressed through a design approach focused on factors of 
economy and utility, akin to the engineering of functional machines.106 Through discussion of a 
number of paradigmatic examples—the airplane, automobile, and cruise liner—Le Corbusier 
advocates for the streamlined, functional aesthetic that an ends-driven methodology could bring to 
the design of the home. He believes that these machines achieve a kind of felicitous harmony with 
the outside world that classical works of art and architecture achieved, and which contemporary 
architecture and design was sorely in need of. Rather than a literal engineering of space, his is an 
idealization and valorization of the engineered machine. This championing of the machine was 
shared by a number of contemporary artistic movements, notably the Italian Futurists and Russian 
Constructivists.107 
Ninety years later, the computer is our ubiquitous machine and the dominant metaphor in our 
cultural imagination. The contemporary notion of robust, utilitarian functionality is located in 
technologies of ubiquitous sensing, embedded computing, cloud storage and analysis, and machine 
perception—accessed through smart phones, personal computers, and increasingly, through smart 
home appliances. Physical, mechanical aspects of technologies have receded into the background 
(though Dobson’s Machine Therapy might try to resurface them)—replaced with an evanescent 
digital immateriality.  
Le Corbusier had a great faith in machines, that they “will lead to a new order both of work 
and of leisure.”108 What more than the computer has led to this great reorganization in our time? 
                                                
106 In a Bachelardian frame the "problem of the house" would be: what do we imagine and expect 
of the house as an intimate psychological site, and how can the architecture/construction of the 
space produce those desired results? 
107 The history of the machine in art is well summarized in Pontus Hultén, The Machine: As Seen 
at the End of the Mechanical Age (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1968). 
108 Corbusier, 101. 
 
 
55 
As the site where computation is physically embedded in the home, the smart home telescopes the 
capabilities of planetary scale computing into intimate, inhabited space: it is our contemporary 
machine for living in. 
4.3 
HOUSE-MACHINES 
If we eliminate from our hearts and minds all dead concepts in regard to the 
house, and look at the question from a critical and objective point of view, 
we shall arrive at the "House-Machine", the mass-production house, healthy 
(and morally so too) and beautiful in the same way that the working tools 
and instruments which accompany our existence are beautiful.109 
- Le Corbusier 
What is Home Without A Mother?110 
-Buster Keaton 
The two passages above juxtapose clinically utilitarian and deeply human perspectives on the 
home. Le Corbusier speaks of the desire to eliminate “all dead concepts” regarding the house to 
achieve a critical and objective point of view. For him, this approach arrives at the “house-
machine”: a mass-production house that is healthy, moral, and beautiful like a tool or instrument. 
In Buster Keaton’s 1920 movie The Scarecrow the phrase “What is Home Without a Mother?” is 
revealed on the underside of the kitchen table as it is hoisted high onto the wall by a pair of 
bachelor-inhabitants, concluding their meal and departing the house. Amidst a thicket of string-
operated contraptions and parodic home automation devices, this plaintive non-sequitur reframes 
all of this mechanized utility in terms of simple familial desire.

56 
The “house-machine” projects discussed in this section demonstrate a similarly complex mix 
of engineered utility and deep human desire manifest in constructed space. Though created in 
different eras and fields of production, each project captures something of Le Corbusier’s total 
mechanizing aesthetic applied to the domain of the house, and stake out the parameters for my 
own research in this space.  
Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye (1931) is a seminal work of high modernist architecture in the 
International Style, and the building most readily associated with his pronouncement of the house 
as “a machine for living in.” It demonstrates his five points of architecture: pilotis lifting the box 
of the house off of the ground,111 an open plan “free” interior, a free façade (non-structural and 
independent from the walls), horizontal ribbon windows, and rooftop gardens. The dominant 
character of the building is its spatial plasticity: its geometric white exterior an elevated form 
floating like a sculpture in the landscape, its interior plan is open to optimal use and free travel, 
walls and windows functioning as viewing devices to frame a series of perspectives onto interior 
courtyards and the surrounding environment. In stripping the building of inessential ornament, 
embracing new structural possibilities through technologies such as reinforced concrete, Le 
Corbusier’s building expresses the machine aesthetic he so admires. 
                                                
111 Pilotis are reinforced concrete columns, replacing structural walls in supporting the house.

Figure 4.3. Le Corbusier, Villa Savoye (1931) 
Buster Keaton’s 1920 film The Scarecrow opens with two men in a small domestic interior. 
Over the first third of the film, they are seen operating the architecture in various ways in a series 
of mechanistic gags: slamming a door to pull a tooth, swinging condiments and eating utensils 
through the air, hoisting the kitchen table to reveal the “home without a mother” question posed 
above (See Figure 4.4 below). Every domestic appliance in this home has a double purpose, such 
 
 
58 
as the shaving mirror which flips to reveal a portrait of a love interest. Keaton’s building is the 
“house as tool” in Le Corbusier’s conception.  
Additionally, the film manifests a systems description of the home in exchange with its 
environment: food waste drops through the wall into a pig pen on the outside, bath water flows to 
replenish a duck pond. Though the film’s action moves on beyond the limits of the house, this 
machinic apartment—home as a site and system—establishes a mechanical context for the rest of 
the film. The plot unfolds through a series of mechanistic pratfalls (recalling Bergson’s theory of 
humor as the unexpected interruption of mechanical human motion112) as the two main characters 
pursue the affections of a woman, ending with Keaton’s character marrying her in a wedding 
officiated mid-stream while mounted on a motorcycle. The story continues, perhaps, into the film 
One Week (also from 1920, and co-starring the same female lead), where the protagonist and his 
newly wedded bride construct and inhabit a first home.

Until recently, the smart home was a fictional construction, discussed in the writings of Ray 
Bradbury, Adolfo Bioy Casares, J.G. Ballard, and others.  
Bradbury’s short story, “There Will Come Soft Rains”113 centers on one such fictional smart 
home. Bradbury’s house contains a variety of “smart home” technologies: voice interfaces, robotic 
appliances for cooking and cleaning, in-wall displays, home monitoring systems, and smart smoke 
and fire protection systems. The story opens with a synthetic voice reciting the date, time, and

reminders for the inhabitants beginning with a summary of the day’s events. As the textual 
narration moves from room to room describing this fictional smart home, it gradually reveals the 
absence of human inhabitants. Mid-morning (“ten-fifteen” in the story), while describing the 
garden and sprinklers surrounding the house, we learn that the home’s inhabitants have perished 
in what is apparently a nuclear explosion, “their images burned on wood in one titanic instant.”114 
This story dwells on the quotidian rhythms of domestic space, manifest through the routinized 
actions of a number of robotic agents. Human tragedy and loss is expressed through the absence 
of inhabitants, with unsupervised automation run amok in the aftermath of a nuclear apocalypse. 
One full day after the story begins, after a midnight crescendo of mechanical breakdown and self-
immolation, the story concludes with the home as a skeleton of burnt walls and a molten electronic 
nervous system announcing the arrival of the new day to an empty field, using what remains of its 
machinic voice. 
Adolfo Bioy Casares’ 1964 novel The Invention of Morel functions poetically in this zone of 
inhabited space, ubiquitous machine observation, absent others, and the psychology of loss and 
desire.115 In the book a protagonist is stranded on a remote island, and over the course of the 
narrative he pieces together the parameters of a total reality-recording device (Morel’s eponymous 
invention), the life-like “physical illusions” it projects, and the past events of a looping drama that 
the system sustains. In parallel with the protagonist, we learn of the illusory nature of the 
“inhabitants” of the island (first taken as real), and follow him as he attempts to integrate himself 
into this endless, repeating cycle of their projected images. The central conceit of this story—a

human falling in love with the immaterial illusion of an image—echoes the myth of Pygmalion 
falling for his statue of Galatea. 
Multiple aspects of Casares’ story are relevant to the idea of the smart home and provide 
compositional references for my own project on the subject: the island (an encapsulated site), is 
monitored by a totalizing observational system that captures the texture of activity in that space. 
This system produces a distilled representation of those events, and the resultant experience loops 
in perpetuity, suspended in illusionistic stasis.  
Numerous projects out of academic labs, tech startups, and corporate research parks imagine 
concrete future possibilities in the smart home space. The most compelling for me is Deb Roy’s 
Human Speechome project (2006-present) from the MIT Media Lab’s Cognitive Machines Group, 
with its intense mix of the personal and the scientific.116 For this project, Roy installed an “ultra-
dense” sensing apparatus in his home: 11 cameras and 14 microphones comprehensively 
monitored interior space, accumulating approximately 300GB of data per day.117 Over a three year 
period of site observation, he captured 90,000 hours of video and 140,000 hours of audio 
documenting the life of his son from birth to 3 years of age.118 In his TED Talk, “The Birth of a 
Word,” Roy discusses how this apparatus and subsequent analytic techniques enable novel data 
explorations leading to new insights about the genesis of speech and language.119

In constructing a formal research apparatus to observe his family in vivo, Roy’s project aligns 
with traditions of scientific self-experimentation and the personalized analyses of the Quantified 
Self120 movement. His project becomes something complex and monumental: he has leveraged 
resources from a massive research institution (MIT), to build a panoptic system, documenting the 
intimate familial process of raising a young child. This resembles an art project (a work to be 
inhabited) while chasing “scientific” aims. Roy seems to recognize some of this raw poetic 
implication of science as portraiture: at the end of his TED talk, he recounts his son’s realization

that he could share this unique data portrait with his own children someday. Roy built his own 
Post-Partum Document. 
To return to Le Corbusier, I will end with what I view as Le Corbusier’s true “machine for 
living in”: his Cabanon built in 1952 Roquebrune-Cap-Martin in the South of France. This was a 
modest vacation property that Le Corbusier designed and built to resemble a rustic wood cabin. 
As he describes it: “I have a castle on the Riviera, it measures 3.66 by 3.66 meters. It’s for my 
wife, and is extremely comfortable and cosy.”121 The cabin is situated on the rock hillside 
overlooking the ocean, adjacent to the Etoile de Mere restaurant and Eileen Gray and Jean 
Badovici’s modernist villa E-1027.122  
Aside from the conspicuous lack of a kitchen (the cabin was attached to a restaurant), this 
space expresses an extremely reduced typology of inhabited space including: “a working area, a 
resting area, lavatory, wash-basin, a table, storage cupboards and a coat-rack ... concentrated into 
a square cell measuring 3.66m by 3.66m and 2.26m high.”123 The cabanon interior combines a 
Modernist utility stripped of ornament with the outwards appearance of a rustic hunter’s cabin, 
itself a sort of unadorned functionalism.

Figure 4.6. Le Corbusier, Le Cabanon (1951). 
The cabanon is an intimate space par excellence. Le Corbusier designed it for his wife, as a 
vacation spot. And after her death in 1957, he continued to use the space as a personal retreat until 
his death in 1965. Le Corbusier, an experienced swimmer, drowned off of the coast by the cabanon 
at the age of 1977, leading speculation as to suicide or possible intentional death.124 
While Le Corbusier’s other buildings may have demonstrated a machine aesthetic, inspired 
by the beautiful efficiency of the ends-driven engineering process of large machines, the cabanon 
expresses a different sort of utility. This building expresses a bare functionalism that has more in

common with Henry David Thoreau’s idea of reduced or essential living, expressed in Walden and 
the home that he constructed at Walden Pond: “I went to the woods because I wished to live 
deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life...”125 Like Thoreau’s cabin or Bachelard’s cave 
or hut, the cabanon is a house stripped to its essence. Rather than the new stylistic language of 
International Modernism, Le Corbusier’s cabanon expresses a simpler functionalism that hearkens 
back to an earlier time.  
Le Corbusier’s cabanon synthesizes a number of these in my research: it is an intimate site, it 
is the epitome of unadorned functionalism, transforming economy into an aesthetic, and it is 
overloaded with narratives and meanings. Constructing one’s own home, as Thoreau did at 
Walden, is a quintessentially American pursuit.  
By comparison, the functionality of the cabanon illustrates a core irony of the commercial 
smart home: its inutility, and inessential nature. Though marketed through the fantasy of utility, as 
stream-lining consumption, securing the home, and facilitating the free flow of information 
through natural interfaces, the smart home provides mere technological luxury. A most efficient, 
utilitarian, economical, machine-like implementation of living space would better resemble the 
engineered quarters of space station, submarine, or small cabin.  
Together, these examples highlight the multiple dimensions of the complex engagement with 
the home in my dissertation work. They evoke contrasts between essential living and the technical 
luxury of the smart home; between the home as a place of private intimacy and of constant machine 
observation. They consider the implications of robotic agents and machine observers in domestic

space. As we enmesh human-computer interactions more deeply in our lives, we shift to an era of 
human-computer cohabitation, and ubiquitous sensing is our new domestic condition.

SITE OBSERVATION 
In evaluating systems the artist is a perspectivist considering goals, 
boundaries, structure, input, output, and related activity inside and outside 
the system.126 
- Jack Burnham 
When I was ready, I turned on the receivers of simultaneous action. Seven 
days have been recorded. I performed well: a casual observer would not 
suspect that I am not part of the original scene… I arranged the records; the 
machine will project the new week eternally.127 
- Bioy Casares 
4.4.1 Instrumentalized Home 
A Machine for Living In has two phases: the construction and inhabitation of a functional 
smart home system, followed by an exhibition of processed data as a layered digital arts 
installation. This section describes the hardware and sensing setup for the site observation phase 
of the project. I identify the key experiential layers of domestic space to be engaged, working as a 
“perspectivist” in Burnham’s description above, performing an analysis of the home as site and 
system. I match these points of interest with effective technologies for capturing home activity. 
Like Morel’s invention in Casares’ novel, these are the “receivers of simultaneous action” for this 
project. I then discuss the parameters of site observation and the scope of collected data. 
In this process of system design, my “machine for living” aims for a functional perception of 
space in its physical, psychological, and human dimensions. This contrasts with commercial smart

home goals of providing frictionless shopping experience, the ambient production of marketable 
personal information, and the refinement of corporate machine perception models.128 For my 
purposes, the house is an observing instrument tasked with producing a durable portrait of intimate 
life. 
As described in 4.1 above, home is an overloaded site: a space of language, bodily practice, 
quotidian narrative, physical actions, cultural codes, and a constructed space. The sensing 
apparatus created for this project records these multiple strata of experience through physical 
sensing, cameras, sound recording, and 3d imaging and spatial representation, as described in 
Table 4.1 below. The particular techniques used extend the processes of machine perception 
developed for my earlier projects such as Convex Mirror, Solipsist, and Rover, now situated and 
embedded within a real, lived space: the inhabited home. The topology of the situation has 
changed: rather than staging experimental encounters between human and machine as coequal 
entities in some exterior context, now the humans reside within the sensing machine. The home is 
instrumentalized: transformed from inert inhabited space into a documentary apparatus and 
impassive technological observer.

The identification and selection of sensing sites for this project is itself a descriptive endeavor. 
Rooms in the home present a natural taxonomy of spaces: bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, living 
room, basement. Each is suggestive of particular functions, and particular psychology (Bachelard). 
The appliances, furniture, and objects in the house provide a secondary list of possible sites of 
engagement. A quick inventory of everyday objects provides their own suggestive meanings and 
histories: the bed, alarm clock, shower, toilet, sink, oven, toaster, microwave, fridge, television, 
and couch. Finally, the commercial smart home industry provides a variety of targets ripe for 
parody employing the debased “smart” descriptor: smart beds, smart sheets, smart kitchen knobs, 
smart door locks. My original sketch of potential sensing sites (Figure 4.7) shows this dense and 
overloaded perspective on home sensing.

Figure 4.7. Initial home sensing sites identified in the home 
What I have developed for this project is a general strategy for home sensing that can be 
opportunistically extended with the inclusion of new technologies. The specific sensors, platforms, 
and processors used are unimportant: what matters is engaging the identified sites in the home 
space. These are the anchors of meaning for the piece. They define the essential, functional 
requirements for the sensing apparatus, and are my assessment of “the problem of the house.” 
The network topology of this real-time house sensate was a centralized hub with wireless 
sensing nodes as shown in Figure 4.8 below. Individual nodes were either physical sensors, digital 
microphones, or digital video cameras, all running on-sensor analysis and filtering. Cameras and 
microphones were attached to embedded Linux systems (Raspberry Pi) running basic sound and 
 
 
70 
image event detection. Physical sensors were programmed to only transmit state changes through 
configurable thresholds of activation and temporal criteria. Shifting these basic levels of 
intelligence out to the edge of the network (“edge computing”129) saved on network traffic, density 
of stored data, and harnessed the available computational resources of the various sensors most 
efficiently.

Geometric Space 
This project commenced with a manual survey of the built space of the home using a tape 
measure and pen and paper. These measurements were then consulted to produce a 3D CAD model 
of the home using the Rhinoceros 3D software,130 as seen in Figure 4.9. In a later phase, I used a 
handheld 3D scanner (repurposed Microsoft Kinect131) and Real-Time Appearance-Based 
Mapping (RTAB-Map) software132 to create 3d point cloud models of built space. These were 
cleaned and edited using MeshLab133 and Rhinoceros 3D to produce point cloud models on the 
order of 10 million 3D vertices per room.

4.4.3 Physical Sensors 
The first layer of sensing in this project are the physical sensors. These are embedded, situated 
devices attached to particular locations in the house, each using different sensing technologies to 
capture tangible physical interactions in the home space. Table 4.2 shows the various sensing 
modalities, sensing sites, and technologies deployed for this project.

All physical sensors in the house were connected to Particle Photon wireless controllers.134 
Photons combine a STM32 ARM Cortex M3 microcontroller and a Cypress Wi-Fi chip with a 
number of standard digital interfaces (I2C, I2S, Serial) and analog and digital pinouts. Individual 
code was adapted for each sensor from a common housenode codebase I developed specifying 
naming conventions, communication protocols (OSC), and over-the-air programmable 
configuration options (not requiring a USB connection). Nodes were given descriptive names and 
could be reconfigured live with OSC messages. Node names, server addresses, and sensory and 
temporal thresholds were stored in onboard Flash memory where they would remain after power 
was turned off. Once the nodes were attached to physical sites and configured, these settings 
remained largely unchanged for data collection periods. Figure 4.10 shows sensors installed on 
various sensing sites in the home.

4.4.4 Video Nodes 
Video data was captured from a number of overhead vantage points using embedded Linux 
systems (Raspberry Pi 3135 and Raspberry Pi Zero W136) with circular fisheye lenses137 and the 
PiKrellCam motion triggered recording software.138 Video was recorded at 15fps and 1560x1080, 
the maximum resolution and framerate possible for a full fisheye view given this image sensor and 
the inbuilt constraints on the video processing capabilities of the Raspberry Pi.

Software parameters were tuned to capture the movements of all inhabitants of the house 
(animal, human, and baby human) across various bodily scales and viewing distances, and to 
ignore changes in environmental lighting where possible.139 This amounted to a first level of 
intelligence implemented in the sensing approach. Video was further filtered as described in the 
following section. Inhabitant tracking was accomplished with custom code written in Python using 
OpenCV140, also describe below.  
                                                
139 Parameters included size of motion activation regions, magnitude thresholds for calculated 
visual motion, duration of motion trigger, and duration of pre- and post-event recording. All 
were set through pikrellcam software configuration files.

Additional video data was recorded through thermal imaging cameras (FLIR Lepton141) 
running on a Raspberry Pi. This produced very low resolution (80x60 pixels, 16 bits per pixel) 
video at low frame rates (1 fps), but was a novel mode to record traces of human presence and 
inhabitation through lingering heat signatures. Figure 4.12 below shows successive infrared frames 
from an overnight recording session of the bed.

4.4.5 Audio Nodes 
Audio data was gathered through a number of audio nodes consisting of omni MEMS 
microphones, the InvenSense ICS-43432142 attached to embedded Linux systems (Raspberry Pi) 
running open-source voice activity detection software webrtc-vad.143 Figure 4.13 shows an audio 
node. The circuit for the microphone was designed and fabricate by the artist, and is documented 
online.144 The sound listening service was written in Python, and only audio classified as “voice

activity” was recorded to disk. Audio was recorded at 48kHz sample rate and 24-bit sample depth, 
to give the greatest degree of fidelity for later analysis and synthesis. In the analysis phase, audio 
features were extracted, clustered, and resynthesized as discussed in the following section.

4.4.6 
Black Box Recorder 
Centralized event logging and data storage was accomplished through a single embedded 
Linux system with attached disk storage. This device, blackbox.local, had an attached Real Time 
Clock (RTC) with battery backup to create a master clock for the home system, and stored 
incoming sensor messages as well as aggregating sound and video files.  
In commercial aviation the flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) are 
the two pieces of technology colloquially known as the black box recorder. They create a 
comprehensive running record of the physical state of the aircraft, pilot actions, and cockpit 
conversations for some prior period of time. I strove for a similar functionality through the site-
 
 
78 
observation system I developed for this piece, likening the data logger and file storage to a black 
box recorder installed in the home (itself an encapsulated site like an aircraft). 
 
Figure 4.14. Black box recorders 
4.4.7 What the Machine Saw 
The combined approaches above formed a comprehensive engagement with the home as an 
intimate site and produced large corpora of audio, visual, spatial, and physical sensing data. Taken 
together, these materials provide a composite image of inhabitation. The scale and heterogeneous 
character of this data provided complex challenges both computationally and compositionally, in 
cleaning the data and in processing it to produce meaningful distillations. Over the course of this 
site observation, the project recorded 40GB of compressed video data, 60 GB of uncompressed 
audio data, and approximately 200,000 sensor activations. 
A Machine for Living In differs from my earlier work in its integrative intent: my aim with 
the project is to place these diverse experiential aspects of place within a unified frame, where 
 
 
79 
each type of information can communicate with the others. Secondly, the scale of data collected 
for this project presents new challenges: the sensing apparatus produced hundreds of hours of 
audio and video, tens of thousands of sensor readings, and millions of point cloud points. Data 
storage and analysis were problems to be solved. Finally, the compositional challenge with this 
project is to produce meaningful distillations of domestic activity, and to manifest these 
experiences in an exhibition scenario. My compositional approach and methodological models are 
discussed in the following section.  
The goal of the sensing approach was to create a transcript of activities, a record of speech, 
images of inhabitation. Following Perec, to document the infra-ordinary: 
What speaks to us, seemingly, is always the big event, the untoward, the 
extra-ordinary: the front-page splash, the banner headlines. Railway trains 
only begin to exist when they are derailed, and the more passengers that are 
killed, the more the trains exist. Aeroplanes achieve existence only when 
they are hijacked. The one and only destiny of motor-cars is to drive into 
plane trees.… How should we take account of, question, describe what 
happens every day and recurs everyday: the banal, the quotidian, the 
obvious, the common, the ordinary, the infra-ordinary, the background 
noise, the habitual?145

CONSTRUCTED HOME 
A house that has been experienced is not an inert box. Inhabited space 
transcends geometric space.146 
- Gaston Bachelard 
The second phase of A Machine for Living In is an exhibition of processed domestic data as a 
multilayered digital arts installation. In this section I discuss the technical and compositional 
problems of working with the complex, multi-modal data produced in phase one of the project:

how to synthesize diverse machine observations into a singular, cohesive viewer experience. I 
describe my approach to data analysis, visual and temporal composition, and exhibition design for 
the project.  
A Machine for Living In, the exhibition, is a signifying system and sculptural non-site. The 
piece necessarily accomplishes dimensional reduction of data, sculptural distillation of form, and 
the computational analysis and classification of domestic activity. Recorded site data is filtered 
through machine perception processes, then composed by the artist in a process of joint human-
machine authorship. 
4.5.1 Exhibition Space 
 
Figure 4.15. A Machine for Living In, exhibition view 
 
 
81 
The inaugural exhibition of A Machine for Living In was at the Foster Art Gallery at 
Westminster College in New Wilmington, PA, from August through October 2017. 
Compositionally, the installation created a spatialized representation of the data gathered in phase 
one of the project. This entire show is to be viewed as a sculptural non-site (Smithson) representing 
material gathered at the primary site, the home. A multi-layered exhibition, the project combines 
audio, video, text, digital drawings, and a small constructed room within the room. Figure 4.16 
below shows the key elements of the exhibition labelled on a floor plan for the installation. 
 
Figure 4.16. A Machine for Living In, exhibition floor plan 
The project announces itself before viewers enter the space of the gallery. A looping 24-
minute audio piece fills the room and spills out into the hallway and surrounding space of the 
 
 
82 
building. Dogs’ barks, babies’ cries, and other domestic noises punctuate the local sonic 
environment and invite viewers into the show.  
Encountering the piece through the front entrance as shown in Figure 4.17, viewers experience 
multiple competing forms and modes of representation operating in a shared space of signification. 
To the left is a small room encapsulated in bright yellow contour lines. In the back third of the 
piece (the left-hand side of the above floor plan) various representations of domestic space vie for 
representational authority: 3d architectural scans floating in a digital null space on a monitor to the 
left, brightly colored panels on the floor illustrate a geometric house layout, densely rendered 
drawings on the right wall show patterns of motion in the space, and directly ahead a large flat 
screen television shows overhead views of each room in the house in a twenty-four minute video 
matched to the audio composition playing in the room. In relation to my past work and research 
trajectory, this exhibition most directly resembles the Father-Daughter Art Show: individual 
pieces employing diverse modes of representation communicate with one another to create a 
complicated, layered experience for the viewer. 
 
 
83 
  
Figure 4.17. A Machine for Living In, front view looking in 
Looking to the right (Figure 4.18), in a small nook past the row of motion trail drawings, a 
vertical monitor plays a textual sensor narrative, accompanied by photos of sensors and sensing 
sites documented in situ.  
 
 
84 
 
Figure 4.18. A Machine for Living In, right hand side of exhibition 
Different perspectives through the space create new meanings combining elements along lines 
of site. Looking forward from the rear of the piece, as in Figure 4.19 below, the brightly colored 
floor plan tiles contrast with the floating point cloud representation of the house on the screen to 
the right, while at the same anchoring the yellow wireframe box of the white space / smart home 
seen at the front of the exhibition. These different representations resonate off of one another in 
the exhibition space. 
 
 
85

4.5.2 Visual Elements 
The primary visual element of the exhibition is the overhead video playing on the large 
monitor at the back of the room, shown in Figure 4.20 below. This top-down fisheye panopticon 
offers a comprehensive and omniscient perspective on the home and its inhabitants as they 
unwittingly carry out the activities of the day. 
 
 
86 
 
Figure 4.20. A Machine for Living In, one day, still from 24-minute video 
This visual perspective emphasizes both a flattening seriality to the rooms of the house (as 
just a finite set of room boxes), and the essential encapsulation of interior space. The distortions 
induced by the geometry of the fisheye lenses make the periphery nearly unreachable: as people 
or objects approach the edge of the frame they shrink to miniscule proportions. Windows and doors 
are similarly rendered opaque, thus the only signs of the exterior environment surrounding the 
home are evident in the varying lighting conditions in the rooms. Room light is momentarily 
transformed as clouds pass by the sun, and brightness gradually cycles over the course of the day. 
Due to the fisheye lens, each room is focused around a spherical microcosm anchored on the center 
of the frame, a zone of pictorial enlargement where people and animals dominate their 
surroundings.  
The room scans seen in Figure 4.21 afford a more immediate perspective on interior space. 
The video shows a series of rotating views of the rooms of the house floating in a black digital 
 
 
87 
non-space. Here light emanates from the thousands of three-dimensional points captured by the 3d 
scanning technology. These rooms are purposefully devoid of human presence but show traces of 
inhabitation in the casual detritus of everyday life: books on counters, papers strewn about, lights 
left on. Models were captured from within the rooms but are viewed from the outside: producing 
exterior views of the interior of the house. These scans demonstrate a painterly aesthetic in their 
loose digital materiality, and situate the viewer immersively in the inhabited space of the home. 
They combine individual rooms (basement, kitchen, living room) in a digital non-space, creating 
more of a virtual sculptural object than a video piece. 
 
Figure 4.21. Room Scan, still from animation 
Juxtaposed with the room scans and overhead video, on the floor we have a brightly colored 
geometric representation of the floor plan of the house. This element was added to anchor the 
ground plane of the exhibition in the ground plane of the house, to manifest something of the 
 
 
88 
architectural CAD modelling done for the project (see Figure 4.22 below), and lends color to the 
exhibition as a meta-compositional decision, balancing the other visual elements in the room. 
 
 
Figure 4.22. Floor plan in CAD, floor plan and 3D scans in the exhibition. 
Along the long wall to the right we have a series of motion trail drawings derived from video 
observation of the house, shown in Figure 4.23. These digital prints recall the line drawings from 
Convex Mirror. No longer mechanically concentrated in the body of a drawing machine, here the 
“machine observer” is dispersed in the house (one camera in each room), and the drawings are 
produced at a remove from the observed space. But the descriptive intent is similar, to produce a 
temporally layered image of place. Bachelard: 
Thus we cover the universe with drawings we have lived. These drawings 
need not be exact. They need only to be tonalized on the mode of our 
internal space.147 
Figure 4.24 below shows an example frame of overhead video from the living room 
demonstrating people detection and extracted motion trails. On the right we see the accumulated

The last wall mounted elements in the exhibition are the textual sensor narratives and the 
photographs of the sensing sites, show in Figure 4.25 below. These provide a reduced digital and 
textual representation of the home. On the vertical screen, a scrolling text feed lists sensor 
activations as they occurred in the house. To the right are photographs showing the sensors in situ, 
attached to appliances and parts of the house. Combined with the audio piece and the overhead 
video, this sensor narrative provides a third temporal representation summarizing activity in the 
home.

4.5.3 
Model Smart Home / Home of the Future 
 
Figure 4.26. A Machine for Living In, model smart home 
The final visual element of the project is a model smart home / home of the future, seen in 
Figure 4.26 above. This is a room within a room, a blank white space outlined with a bright yellow 
geometric wireframe, constructed within the space of the gallery. The room is arranged to resemble 
Le Corbusier’s cabanon, with its reduced typography of inhabited space as an interior living cell. 
Within the room there is a bed, a chair, and a mirror, simple accompaniments to domestic life. The 
room asserts its purity with a very modernist or science fictional aesthetic: all white space, light 
wood, reflective mirror, and fluorescent yellow geometry.148 
                                                
148 For modernist white spaces in general, see THX 1138, directed by George Lucas (Warner 
Bros., 1971)., or Ernest Hemingway’s “A Clean, Well-Lighted Place” in Ernest Hemingway, 
Winner Take Nothing (New York: Collier Books, 1987). 
 
 
92 
This room expresses a simple encapsulation of domestic activity. Much like a submarine, 
spaceship, or studio apartment, it contains the necessary elements of reduced or essential living in 
a closed space. The compositional references for this open frame construction are both the glowing 
lines of CAD geometry (wireframe models), and the encapsulated space of Francis Bacon’s round 
areas, arenas, and cubes — “the operative field.”149 This painted structure is particularly evident 
in the two exterior images from his triptych Sweeney Agonistes (1967, Figure 4.27 below). On the 
left and the right sides, we see these boxlike structures: open to the air, with a solid ground plane, 
a stage, and some mirrored or televisual curved imaging plane on the right-hand side.  
 
Figure 4.27. Francis Bacon, Sweeney Agonistes (1967) triptych 
Bacon aims to achieve an isolation and encapsulation of the body: avoiding the “figurative, 
illustrative, and narrative character the Figure would necessarily have if it were not isolated.”150 
The spaces he constructs have been called variously a cage, arena, vitrine, or boxing ring. What I

find most compelling about these paintings is the contrast between the smooth pastel panels and 
clean curved surfaces of the containing environments and the comingled fleshy masses within. 
This compositional dynamic plays out between the visceral explosion of bodily matter on the chair 
in the central image, and the spatial and organic constraint in the two bracketing images. These 
paintings map out a triangulation of viewership between the massed bodies on the platforms, the 
mirrors or screens on the right (including the staring figure on the phone), and the embodied 
spectator (us) looking at the paintings and seeing both subject and mediating observer / device.  
 
Figure 4.28. Detail of bed, mirror, and chair in model smart home 
Figure 4.28 above shows a detail view the model smart room I have constructed. The objects 
within embody traces of inhabitation. The mirror displays video originally recorded through the 
bathroom mirror, playing back what it saw here in the exhibition. The bed similarly plays traces 
 
 
94 
of body heat captured in the house. Covered with an array of heating elements and a 
thermochromic blanket,151 the fluctuations in temperature of the bed outline visually reveal the 
outline of a body in white against the gray ground. If the viewer touches the blanket, they can feel 
real heat emanating from this image. The plain wooden chair has an attached piezo sensor that 
visually registers when a viewer sits in it.  
I call this constructed space the model smart home because it serves as a nexus of imaginations 
and concrete manifestations of smart home technologies. Replaying recorded traces of absent 
individuals, the objects within recall the automated remnants of the smart house in Bradbury’s 
“There Will Come Soft Rains.”

Temporal Composition and Joint Authorship

materials cannot.152

The overhead video, audio, and sensor narrative screens function together as the temporal 
core of the project. They all participate in the same kind of time compressed edit: structured as one 
complete day in a twenty-four-minute loop, where one minute represents one hour. The larger

potential Burnham describes above. The final pieces in the show are products of joint human-
machine authorship consisting of data analysis, classification, structured query, and 
algorithmically assisted edits. These efforts align with technical fields of computational 
creativity,154 algorithmic composition, and computer supported cooperative work (CSCW).155 
This looping structure was largely inspired by Bioy Casares’ story The Invention of Morel. 
Existential loop. Endless recurrence (eternal return). Temporal durability. Giving oneself over to 
the representation. 
The video piece was visually described in the previous section with its six overhead views of 
interior space. The source material is doubly filtered. On site, the recording system only captured 
when motion was detected: thus, all events on screen in the resulting piece are moments where 
motion was detected in the original house context. To detect motion, the video software used 
relatively simplistic camera motion vector fields that are produced as part of the hardware video 
compression process. Thus, detected motion means that some object, person, or animal moved in 
the space, or that some spurious change in lighting registered as “motion.” Thus, there is a need 
for a second level of filtering.  
Video was additionally processed using computer vision techniques implemented with 
OpenCV156 in python. Foreground/background segmentation was accomplished using the K-
nearest neighbor background subtractor implemented in OpenCV.157 Background pixels were 
masked out, the foreground image was thresholded, and contours were detected. Contours size was

tuned to capture animals, human adults, and children in the home imaging space. Processed clips 
containing tracked motion were selected for inclusion in the final video composition to provide a 
continuous image of inhabitation throughout the course of the day. 
This kind of structured query is an approach to algorithmic video editing employed by James 
Coupe in his project General Intellect (2014-15). His piece engages the pool of internet-mediated 
labor available through the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) marketplace158 to produce a 
collective portrait through the platform. Coupe’s piece relies on the anonymous production of 
MTurk workers, paying them to record one minute of video per hour between 9am and 5pm. 
Workers additionally were required to write captions for their videos and provided detailed 
metadata about themselves.159 These rules structure participation for the MTurk workers, and 
provide a framework for algorithmic composition of the resultant media. 
At the Morningside Academy in Seattle, Coupe’s piece was exhibited as a series of thirteen 
queries on the dataset: demographically, temporally, or by any other metadata the workers 
provided or that could be extracted.160 The resultant videos—manually labelled, then 
computationally queried according to manually selected criteria—are then layered into a formerly 
inhabited site, the abandoned middle school as shown in Figure 4.29 below. Viewers experience 
these intimate video snapshots in the context of a site that is itself marked by absence, the 
abandoned school. The locus of creative agency in this piece is difficult to attribute. The videos 
are multiply authored: by the original MTurk workers, by the artist in selecting search criteria, by

My project aims for a similar sort of structured query. My materials (the model or data set) 
are structured semantically (the names of sensors), spatially (room locations), and temporally 
(when data was captured / activity occurred). Additionally, I use software tools to produce a 
number of additional layers of metadata: for instance, using machine learning classifiers to identify 
activities and objects in the scene, classifying sonic events, and recognizing speech data in the 
audio recordings.  
The second temporal loop in A Machine for Living In is the audio playing in the room. Like 
the video, the audio is structured on a twenty-four-minute day, where one minute in viewer 
experience represents one hour in the day. Initially intended just to record speech in the house 
through the use of the voice activity detection software, the machine listening system gathered a 
much broader set of matching sonic events. As with the video, a second level of classification was 
necessary.  
 
 
98 
The techniques employed for audio analysis extend work done with Michael McCrea for 
Rover, discussed in our SIGGRAPH paper from 2017.161 In this instance, detected sounds were 
analyzed using the SuperCollider Music Information Retrieval (SCMIR) library162 implemented 
in the SuperCollider digital audio language. Audio samples were split using beat detection, and 
analyzed with SCMIR to produce twelve dimensional descriptive vectors for each segment. 
Descriptors consisted of: 4 Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, the Spectral Centroid, a 6-point 
Chromagram, and the Fast Fourier Transform crest. These audio descriptors were clustered using 
k-Means163 and HDBSCAN,164 as shown in Figure 4.30 below. T-SNE handles the dimensional 
reduction necessary to display the detected twelve-dimensional clusters in a 2-dimensional 
image.165

Figure 4.30. Classified audio data, clustered, and visualized with t-SNE 
To produce the final audio composition, clustered audio data was explored using an interactive 
cluster browser GUI written in SuperCollider. Particular clusters for each hour of audio were noted 
for later use. These files and clusters were then fed into a modified GrainScanner instrument,166 
altered to work with HDBSCAN cluster labels. The GrainScanner uses granular synthesis on 
samples grouped around the previously identified clusters of interest to synthesize representative 
audio for each hour in the house.  
I liken the aesthetic effect of the audio process to Juan Pampin’s ambisonic audio piece A 
Line.167 His piece collapses sonic experience across the various sites and durations of a trip on the 
historic Linea A in Buenos Aires. My piece collapses sonic material spatially and temporally in 
the home.

Pampin’s piece starts at the beginning of the train route with binaural audio recording of the 
composer and his son, traversing through a series of sites on the train and the streets above. The 
initial sounds of the train transitions to the drumbeat of a parade on the avenue above. Quickly we 
move to the next aural scene: a bell ringing and dog barking. Back to the train, then traffic sounds. 
The sonic material of the train’s journey serves as the connective tissue throughout the piece.  
This aural space is plastic and malleable: a door slamming transforms into a truck idling. 
There is acute perceptual ambiguity about what is real and what is constructed. Pampin’s piece is 
bracketed at the start and finish with sounds of the train beginning and ending its run, layered with 
short conversational exchanges with his son. He documents a place and experience that are no 
longer available (the historic train route), with sonic material recorded in the last period before the 
train cars were removed and replaced. Intimate and doubly documentary, the piece is biographical, 
framed as a shared experience between father and son.  
My own work, while rendered in stereo, produces a similar collapsing of space and time in 
the representation of place. In my project, the space is all internal, encapsulated within the confines 
of the home. Audio was recorded using audio nodes, and processed and classified using machine 
listening techniques. In choosing particular clusters and synthesis parameters to represent each 
hour of the day, I am making editorial and creative decisions about the representation of place. 
The third temporal loop in the project is the textual sensor narrative playing on the vertical 
monitor. Over the course of a twenty-four-minute cycle, each minute of viewer experience 
represents one hour of the day. Individual sensor activations are shown through their semantic 
labels, producing texts like “washingmachine toilet toilet frontdoor fridge fridge microwave” that 
create a running record on the vertical monitor. The data is sourced from the time-stamped sensor 
readings transmitted to the black box recorder over the course of the site observation. 
 
 
101 
These recorded activations were aggregated in time to produce a statistical distribution of 
likely sensor activations for each hour. Additionally, total numbers of activations per hour were 
normalized to produce a representative distribution of activation frequency across the hours of the 
day. These simple statistical distributions (seen in Figure 4.31) were used to generate new textual 
narratives using Python code. 
 
Figure 4.31. Sensor frequencies by hour 
This narrative textual display speaks with a kind of deadpan literalism. Like Georges Perec in 
An Attempt at Exhausting a Place in Paris,168 the text is a simple registration of events through a 
descriptive process of creative notation. Where Perec manually inventories his perceptions of place 
(the “infra-ordinary”) through writing, in this case the machine produces a textual transcript of 
material interactions in the home. Though constructed by the artist and shaped through the specific 
assignment of language to sensor activations, the computational sensing apparatus mechanistically

generates this deadpan narration. The type of notational, deadpan, literal voice in this piece is 
popular in conceptual art and contemporary experimental literature, particularly in the practice of 
“Uncreative Writing” championed by Kenneth Goldsmith and Craig Dworkin.169 
All three of the temporal artifacts discussed in this section participate in a durable circularity 
that echoes the experience of Casares’ protagonist, quoted at the beginning of this section. The 
events of some ideal day (in Casares case, an ideal week) repeat in perpetuity. For computer nerds, 
this is the endless loop. These circular structures in time also anchor the temporal experience of 
the viewer in the exhibit, portraying the house as a place of cyclical repetition: diurnal cycles of 
day and night, and bodily rhythms of inhabitation. 
These pieces are all produced through joint human-machine authorship. For the textual 
narration, I gave the systems the words/labels to use in a ventriloquistic effort, but the system 
applies them. I define the limits of the model, the parameters of the space, but the algorithm and 
hardware implement them in a rote and uncreative process. For the video and audio, what the 
viewer sees is a mix of machine classified material and subjective human compositional decisions, 
thus computer supported collaborative work. Each type of judgment, human and machine, is in its 
own way aesthetic: even the audio-visual analysis systems operate on evident phenomenological 
traits of their analyzed materials. Telescoping outwards (to invert Burnham’s perspective), the 
choice of data and training parameters for these machine perception models determine the space 
of comprehension they can achieve. Choices about the representativeness of the resultant media, 
and their communicative effects, are entirely in the subjective judgment of the artist.

Chapter 5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS 
5.1 
CONCLUSIONS ON A MACHINE FOR LIVING IN 
Ultimately . . . systems theory may be another attempt by science to resist 
the emotional pain and ambiguity that remain an unavoidable aspect of 
life.170 
-Jack Burnham 
This project serves dual purposes: to study the home as a site of intimate life, and to evaluate 
the meanings and uses of new smart technologies in that domestic space. To create this project, I 
constructed a home sensing apparatus that recorded what I deemed to be the substantive sites of 
meaning in the home. Installed for a period of months in a real home, this machine observation 
produced rich, multi-modal data, which I have analyzed and processed to create the exhibit 
described above. At the conclusion of the project, I recognize three main areas for future 
development: improvements in instrumentation, new modes of data analysis, and new exhibition 
forms and venues.  
5.1.1 
 Sensing and Home Instrumentation 
While I am satisfied with the receptive scope of the home sensing apparatus, in the area of 
instrumentation there is room for improvement in: 
• Streamlining the deployment of sensors using zero-configuration networks and mesh 
networking. 
                                                
170 Jack Burnham, Great Western Salt Works; Essays on the Meaning of Post-Formalist Art 
(New York: G. Braziller, 1974), 11. 
 
 
104 
• Improving the robustness of network connectivity, for instance automatically 
reconnecting to the network on dropped wireless signal, and improving data 
transmission to re-transmit lost packets.  
• Addition of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensors for monitoring small, mobile objects 
such as forks, spoons, cups, where larger batteries and power supplies are not 
feasible.171  
• Incorporate far-field microphones: using beam-forming and far-field microphone 
arrays to filter spatially, reject noise, and provide directional information about audio. 
• Develop single smart home elements (for instance a heat sensing blanket that both 
records and plays back body heat data) as individual projects. 
My ultimate goal for the instrumentation portion of this project would be to develop these 
sensing technologies into a more unified kit for reading and writing inhabited space. I gave a recent 
workshop on this subject at Carnegie Mellon University,172 using the sensing and networking setup 
I developed for the project to interface with the building we were in. Further work is needed to 
streamline this process and toolset. 
5.1.2 
Data Analysis and Machine Perception 
The second area for future improvement is in the analysis of recorded data. Even with the 
current sensing approach, this project produces a dense set of observed house data that can be 
sliced and processed in a variety of ways. A Machine for Living In proposes the house, and smart

home sensing, as a meeting point between personal analytics and big data science. I am particularly 
interested in extracting higher orders of description in the data processing workflow. Additional 
computer vision, audio analysis, and physical sensing methods can provide more nuanced 
interpretations of domestic activity. Future directions in this area include:  
• Speech and language transcription of all processed data.173 
• Contextual video description including identification of objects, inhabitants, etc.  
• Improved audio feature descriptors and clustering algorithms. 
• Activity classification for audio, video, and physical sensors. 
• Bespoke recognition / classification models trained on house data.  
• Generative models for audio, video, and sensor activations trained on house data. 
I expect that these technical developments for the project will track with the growth and 
availability of new tools in machine learning and data analysis fields. With increased intelligence 
built into these processing tools, the “machine” element of A Machine for Living In will take 
greater authorial responsibility or the resulting works.  
5.1.3 
New Exhibition Forms and Venues 
Beyond the gallery exhibition presented above, A Machine for Living In can be developed for 
a number of new formats, contexts, and presentation scenarios. These include:  
• Using the sensor activations, speech transcription, and other textual descriptions of 
recognized activities to produce an experimental form digital literature. I believe this 
                                                
173 I’ve already done this using Kaldi (accessed March 14, 2018); available from http://kaldi-

https://cloud.google.com/speech/., but did not incorporate those results into the initial exhibition.

is a novel, sensor-driven approach to authoring digital texts, and could be of interest to 
e-literature communities, among others.174 
• Algorithmically assembled video and audio from the project as stand-alone 
experimental video work. This could result from further queries on the existing data, 
or extracting new “details” studying particular elements of the home (for instance a cut 
focused on domestic labor in the kitchen, centered on the stove, fried, and sink).  
• A site-specific installation of the project in the space of an abandoned house. This site 
would be doubly marked with absence: the recorded digital traces of inhabitation 
layered onto a place that is rich with physical signs of absent others. 
Much of the effort in creating this project was invested in developing and testing the 
functional version of the sensing apparatus. Taking the lessons learned from this process, it would 
be valuable to install the system in a significant new space and produce a new dataset. A number 
of future sites of interest that could be profitably engaged as “Machines for Living” include:  
• the workplace175 
• the school176 
• the automobile177 
                                                
174 See Electronic Literature Organization (accessed March 14, 2018); available from 
https://eliterature.org/what-is-e-lit/. 
175 Automation in the workplace is a hot topic both in terms of advanced manufacturing, co-
robotics, and even the recent automation of the commercial storefront with the Amazon Go store 
in Seattle: Amazon Go (accessed March 14, 2018); available from 
https://www.amazon.com/b?node=16008589011. 
176 Contrasting human and machine learning (like Searle’s Room), and also thinking about 
schools as a physical site at a time of rising interest in massively distributed online courses. 
177 The idea of the automobile as a “machine for living” conjures wildly divergent associations, 
from low-tech RV homes and trailers to high-tech Tesla self-driving vehicles. 
 
 
107 
The strategy for each of these contexts is to explore the descriptive potential and conceptual 
ramifications of interpreting the site as a system, and playing out the machine analogy. 
5.2 
MACHINES FOR LIVING: DESIGNING INTROSPECTIVE TECHNOLOGIES 
introspection: "the examination or observation of one's own mental and 
emotional processes." 
introspection: "the ability to examine the type or properties of an object at 
runtime." 
To codify my research practice: this work generalizes to a broader investigation of machine 
living, our contemporary condition of life lived with ubiquitous computing and machine 
perception. Constructing technological experiments and art systems to operate in this space of 
intimate human-machine cohabitation, I aim for a targeted introspection into the nature of human 
and machine. We, as people, need to look inward and ask questions of ourselves and our natures. 
Our technologies, as autonomous machines, should aim for a similar self-examination and critical 
introspection.  
I seek to foster a reciprocal diagnosis, creating mutually revelatory encounters between 
humans and machines, where each reveals something about the other. I use the word diagnosis to 
invoke therapy, because I believe that each part has some essential lack that needs to be addressed.  
Machines for living are technologies that are sufficiently sophisticated to operate as digital 
surrogates and autonomous interlocutors, seamlessly integrating into the everyday. They are 
cybernetic systems and psychological feedback devices, harnessing emerging technologies to 
bring insight about ourselves. I exercise both an optimistic embrace of new technological 
possibilities and a critical examination of their consequences. Future “machines for living” will 
chase these engagements deeper into our intimate lives, to teach us more about how we live them.

VITA 
 
Robert Twomey (b. 1979, Washington, DC) is an artist and engineer exploring the poetic 
intersection of human and machine perception. He exploits the potential of new technologies while 
critically revealing their limits. Engaged with the messy conditions of everyday life, his works ask 
questions about our technologies and ourselves to reveal moments of insight. 
He has created a computer simulation of a grandmother with Alzheimer’s disease, a body of 
work exploring the fantasy of an imaginary daughter, and recreated John Searle’s Chinese Room 
as an exchange between synthetic child voice and robotic child drawing. 
Twomey has worked in a variety of research labs throughout his career, notably the Center 
for the Study of Learning, the Center for Research in Computing and the Arts with Sheldon Brown, 
the Experimental Design Lab with Natalie Jeremijenko, and the Center for Digital Arts and 
Experimental Media. 
Twomey has presented his work at SIGGRAPH, the Museum of Contemporary Art San 
Diego, the Seattle Art Museum, and has been featured by Microsoft and Amazon. He received his 
BS from Yale with majors in Art and Biomedical Engineering, and his MFA in Visual Arts from 
the University of California, San Diego. He is currently an Assistant Professor of Digital Media 
at Youngstown State University.
