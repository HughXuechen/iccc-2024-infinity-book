ABSTRACT 
Generative machine learning models provide opportunities to sup-
port design work in various parts of the design process. This study 
investigates how generative machine learning and large language 
models may play a part in creative design processes of ideation, 
early prototyping and sketching. A workshop was conducted in 
which design practitioners and design researchers developed design 
concepts for a provided design case, with the help of GPT-3. The 
fndings point to three main themes, including i) the practical use-
fulness and limitations of the system in design ideation processes, ii) 
how the form of user interaction shapes users’ expectations of the 
system’s capabilities and potentials, and iii), how the broader dis-
course around AI both limits and enables how co-creative processes 
involving human and AI unfolds. The discussion outlines design 
implications and alternative framings of this kind of co-creative 
design practices based on post-human perspectives on design and 
technology use.

1 INTRODUCTION 
In digitally mediated creative practices, such as interaction design 
and various forms of digital fabrication, smart or intelligent tools 
are becoming increasingly common to support or in various ways 
augment the design process. We are seeing technologies that display 
capabilities that were previously ascribed solely to human actors,

such as design ideation, sketching, and creativity. As a consequence, 
we need to open up for conversations around what role we should 
ascribe to these technologies in design-oriented practices and how 
to integrate them with human values and skills in a co-participative 
fashion. In this paper, we investigate opportunities and concerns 
in co-creative design activities with the use of generative AI sys-
tems, based on large language models (LLMs), and in particular how 
these may be entangled in co-creative design ideation and rapid 
sketching activities. The rapid development of AI and generative 
machine learning technologies [7], such as GPT-3 [5] and most re-
cently ChatGPT, has made it critical to investigate what new forms 
of co-creativity such tools may enable and how it can be shaped to 
align with human values, especially as several of these technologies 
are explicitly designed to act as or resemble intelligent human ac-
tors, being able to produce various forms of original text, images, or 
programming code of a quality in a style that may be indistinguish-
able from content created by human actors. This brings to the table 
questions regarding how to practically integrate such non-domain 
specifc large-scale language models in interaction design practices, 
and how the interactions and analyses that they are capable of, 
difer from existing, more specialized AI-based tools aimed at sup-
porting creative design practices. Notably, these technologies have 
received substantial public and media attention for their impressive 
capabilities in engaging in human-like conversation on a diversity 
of topics, as well as responding to human queries in seemingly 
intelligent and refective ways. However, we argue that there is a 
need to study and refect on how to integrate these kinds of systems 
in interaction design practices without getting stuck in conversa-
tions on the degree to which they are able to mimic or replace 
human skills and activities. Conceptually, this development coin-
cides with theoretical explorations in interaction design research 
around notions such as post-anthropocentric [8] and post-human 
design [34], co-performance [16], more-than-human design [11], 
and machine agency [22], which all suggest a reconsideration of 
the view that humans should be viewed as the only source of cre-
ative agency, to instead see various forms of interactive and digital 
technologies as co-participants and co-creators in the processes of 
generating ideas or in the forming of creative expressions. Most 
fundamentally, by shifting the focus of viewing the human actor as 
the sole locus of creative agency, a number of challenges are raised 
in respect to what it means to do design with these tools, and how 
these emerging practices can be understood in terms of co-creation. 
In this study, we investigated these issues through a workshop in 
which professional and academic interaction designers used GPT-3 
as a resource to develop and sketch out design ideas for a given 
use scenario targeting the emergency waiting room experience 
for families. The practical design exercises were intertwined with

for the use of generative AI systems in interaction design ideation

2 BACKGROUND 
2.1 Computer-supported creativity 
There is substantial interaction design research into ways of sup-
porting the early stages of design processes, such as ideation and 
sketching [10, 12, 14, 36]. Design ideation is commonly conducted 
through group work in more or less structured approaches often 
using well-organised methods. Examples of ways to support such 
processes include various brainstorming approaches, role-play and 
embodied [36] sketching techniques, as well as card-based methods 
[26]. The card-based approaches exist in many variants and aim 
to support designers in actions such as generating design alterna-
tives, team building and collaboration, opening up design spaces, 
reconsidering design problems from new viewpoints, and provid-
ing checklists or refective tools for consideration of values, norms, 
risks, and challenges. Card-based approaches are typically designed 
to be open-endedly used in design exercises and a key aspect of most 
card decks is that designers can easily vary the way they use them 
depending on the user and the context of the particular task at hand. 
The static character of card decks is also what makes them fexible 
and easily shifted between context and settings [26]. There is also a 
range of digital tools and systems developed to support the creative 
processes of designers [10], providing for example generation of 
design alternatives in visual and graphic design, tools for narration 
and storytelling, game-design tools, and support for programming. 
Bernal et al. [4] account for diferent ways computational aids may 
support design, particularly pointing to specifc designer activities 
such as the generation, evaluation, and selection of design solutions. 
They further categorize the resulting designer-computer actions 
as either; a) computer aided actions, providing feedback or facilitat-
ing tasks, b) computer based actions, automating processes, and d) 
computer augmented actions - extending the designer’s capabilities 
to potentially improve the design quality. What becomes apparent 
in this overview, is that a majority of existing support tools for 
designers are highly specialized, potentially providing specifc re-
sponses to the users in ways that may efectively tie on to what the 
user is trying to achieve. This signifcantly difers from the general 
purpose, large language models, that are in focus in this paper. 
Computer-supported creativity could also be discussed in terms 
of co-creation, highlighting tools that also produce actual design 
content through the automation of certain design tasks. The concept 
of computer-aided design (CAD) and the implementation of CAD 
software tools emerged in the 1960s as a means to streamline the de-
sign process and reduce the amount of time and expertise required. 
According to Albaugh et al. [1], CAD systems can be classifed as 
"time-saving systems" that delegate repetitive or time-consuming 
work to the computer, freeing up the designer to focus on the cre-
ative aspects of design. An advancement of CAD is the feld of 
generative design [21], which involves the use of algorithms to gen-
erate design variations and optimize existing solutions, particularly 
in 3D models for industrial design and architecture. A subcategory 
of generative design is grammar-based techniques, which enable 
the automatic creation of complex forms and patterns from simple 
textual specifcations [6]. In general, these computer-aided design 
tools support design and creativity by reducing participation bar-
riers through the automation of complex tasks. Additionally, they 
also facilitate the exploration of design spaces by presenting vari-
ations of potential solutions, which can serve as inspiration for 
design [20]. 
2.2 Prompt engineering and natural language 
interaction 
A key characteristic of the kind of AI systems used in this study is 
that they rely on natural language interaction, allowing the user 
to interact with them in an open-ended chat-based dialogue, to 
some extent resembling that of human-to-human interaction. Fur-
thermore, there are no clear limitations on the kind of topics that 
the system may interact around. It provides potentially relevant 
responses to user input no matter if it concerns cooking, space tech-
nology, or 15th-century history. This type of open-ended black-box 
system introduces a number of challenges for the user in the inter-
action. Studies on voice-based conversational agents such as Alexa 
and Siri, highlight how natural language interfaces do not commu-
nicate their capabilities in the same way as traditional graphical 
user interfaces. Instead, users bring expectations of using natural 
language from other settings, most commonly from interaction with 
other natural language speakers, and adapt their interpretation of 
the system’s response accordingly. [18, 23] 
A diferent perspective on the natural language interaction with 
the large language models such as GPT-3, is in terms of prompt pro-
gramming or prompt engineering, where the focus is not so much on 
mimicking human-to-human conversation, but rather on learning 
how to instruct the system to get appropriate and useful responses.

Design Ideation with AI - Sketching, Thinking and Talking with Generative Machine Learning Models 
DIS ’23, July 10–14, 2023, Pitsburgh, PA, USA 
As noted in previous studies, such as [15], interaction with large 
language models often becomes an issue of struggling with syntax, 
and "cracking the code" for how to talk to the system. Reynolds and 
McDonell [25] note that interaction with a language model that 
draws on natural language interaction can be understood as a form 
of programming in natural language: "Prompt programming is pro-
gramming in natural language, which avails us of an inexhaustible 
number of functions we know intimately but don’t have names 
for. We need to learn a new methodology, but conveniently, we’ve 
already learned the most difcult foundations. The art of prompt 
programming consists in adapting our existing knowledge to the 
peculiarities of interacting with an autoregressive language model" 
(p.3). This highlights how natural language is indeterministic and 
thereby much more complex than traditional programming lan-
guages, potentially making design for natural language interaction 
more challenging. 
2.3 Co-creativity and post-human interaction 
design 
The anthropomorphic and human-like character of the interaction 
with generative AI and large language models challenges existing 
paradigms on the interplay between human and machine in the 
context of creative design and ideation. Contemporary theories 
on post-humanism and post-human design [8, 35], may contribute 
with useful conceptualizations for characterizing activities of co-
creation between humans and artifcial intelligence. This connects 
to the broader conceptual conversation in HCI on material and 
machine agency [2, 3, 11, 22, 29, 32] as being shared, or distributed, 
among humans, machines, and artefacts, and the reconsiderations 
of processes of design and interactivity that these imply. At its 
core, post-human perspectives on design reject the traditional di-
chotomies between humans and machines in favour of a perspective 
on design in which humans and machines are considered to be co-
participants in processes of ideation, design and making. These 
theories put to the fore how human agency must be understood as 
entangled with agencies that stem from non-human entities, e.g. as 
extensively elaborated in notions such as agential realism [3] and 
machine agency [22]. Of particular relevance for the present work 
are studies that question traditional categorizations of design and 
creativity as relying on step-by-step models as going from design 
ideas - to digital representations - to machine execution, and instead 
view humans, materials, and machines as entangled in co-creative 
and co-performative ways [15]. 
We argue that novel artifcial intelligence systems are particu-
larly interesting to explore as a form of non-human co-performer 
as they display properties that resemble those that would be as-
cribed to - or expected by - human actors, such as problem-solving 
and natural language interpretation. An important strand in post-
human and post-anthropocentric interaction design has challenged 
common expectations of AI systems to work as rational predictable 
actors, for instance through notions such as uncertainty [19], im-
perfection [13, 31, 33], and under-determination [1], and the conse-
quences these have on the way we conceptualize and design tools 
and methods for these practices. 
3 STUDY SETUP 
The study was organised as a half-day workshop with eight partici-
pants. The participants consisted of fve professional designers (two 
industrial designers, two organizational designers, and one user ex-
perience designer), and three researchers in interaction design and 
HCI. Before the workshop, the participants were informed about 
the overall goal and the activities that would be conducted. The 
workshop was divided into three phases; a rapid design exercise 
with the support of AI tools for ideation, visualisation and sketching, 
a design refection exercise, and fnally, speculative design activity 
to envision novel usages of AI tools for interaction design. The 
participants were divided into three groups so that each group had 
one participant with prior experience in using the AI system. For 
the initial design exercise, the participants were provided with the 
following design challenge: "You have been asked to radically im-
prove the experience of families with children visiting the emergency 
room, with a particular focus on the waiting room experience." The 
design challenge was created based on the research and outcomes 
from a prior design project. The provided material consisted of a 
brief general description and three more detailed user personas, 
with Figure 2 showing one of the personas as it appeared in the 
material. The design exercise was set up using commonly used 
Figure 2: One of the three personas that were provided to the 
participants as part of the design challenge, and that were 
also incorporated in some template prompts to the AI 
design methods in interaction design and consisted of ten separate 
design activities, as outlined in Table 1. For each of the activities, 
the participants were asked to integrate the use of the AI tool into 
their activities. The setup of the design exercises should not be 
understood as an attempt to create a realistic design situation, since 
the activity was moderated and time-boxed, restricting the design-
ers’ control of the design process. Each activity however resembles 
commonly appearing activities in design, creating opportunities 
for the participants to relate their experiences to experiences from 
their professional practices. 
The AI tools that were used were the GPT-3 model (davinci-
003) from OpenAI [5], used in the "playground"-mode, through 
OpenAI:s webpage (see Figure 3), and the DALL-E 2 model, also 
from OpenAI, for image generation. For each design activity, a 
number of preset templates were generated, with suggestions for 
prompts to use as input to the AI system. Some of the presets were 
more extensive, such as the prompts used for ideation, in which 
the three predefned personas were incorporated into input to the

result in a chat-like interaction, whereas other presets were shorter, 
providing examples of how to ask for variations of a concept or 
to identify problems in a suggested concept. In each activity, the 
participants had to modify the presets, to include their own ideas, 
or to articulate specifc instructions to the AI system. The following 
quotes depict a few example presets that were used: 
Perform a design critique and identify ten problems 
with the proposed design concept: (Add your concept

Provide ten alternative design variations and elabora-
tions of the following design concept: (Add your concept 
here) 
Provide details on how the following concept could be 
realized using both technological and organizational 
means. Also detail an implementation and testing pro-
cess. (Add your concept here) 
The entire session was flmed, and design ideas and sketches from 
the participants were collected. The participants also wrote two 
rounds of individual written refections concerning their experi-
ences and ideas around the use of the AI tools in the design activities. 
The workshop also involved discussions in groups on more general 
questions regarding the use of generative AI in design, such as 
discussing its overall usefulness in design practice, possible novel 
forms of interaction, and how to perceive of unpredictable or unex-
pected behaviour of the system. This part generated both written 
refections from the groups and video recordings of their discus-
sions. The video recordings and written refections were transcribed 
and added to a spreadsheet used for analysis. The fndings were 
then analysed using thematic analysis and open coding. 
4 FINDINGS 
The design phase of the workshop was carried out at a high pace, 
where the three groups worked in parallel with the given challenge, 
through the ten design activities. A majority of the activities re-
quired that the participants interacted with the AI system, but there 
were also activities where the groups worked without a computer, 
such as an initial brainstorming session, and activities in which 
the groups had to narrow down frst to three, and then select one 
design concept to move forward with. As depicted in Figure 1, the 
activities were not fully centred around the computer., often one 
person in a group took responsibility for interacting with the com-
puter, whereas the others took notes on post-its, and organized 
them on a whiteboard. The activities shifted from moments when 
all three group members were engaged with the interactions on 
Figure 3: The playground user interface including parts of 
one of the presets that were used for ideation 
the screen, to activities where they shifted focus from the screen to 
instead interact with each other around the table or standing by the 
whiteboard. Throughout the workshop, a large number of data was 
generated by the AI tools, including concept ideas, concept varia-
tions, lists of potential problems, scenarios, concept art, and mood 
boards. Much of the generated data was quickly discarded by the 
groups, but they were asked to save particularly interesting ones in 
a separate document. The participants were also encouraged to use 
the AI-generated output as inspiration, but they could also come 
up with their own ideas or rewrite AI-generated suggestions in 
any way they liked. Some examples of AI-generated ideas that the 
participants saved include: 
An autonomous AI-sanitizing system with an attached 
camera that can detect dirt and other contaminants on 
the toys in the emergency waiting room 
Waiting room furniture is designed as a labyrinth. With 
see-through glass so separated families can communi-
cate with each other 
An interactive personal augmented reality playmate for 
kids that guide, support and provide comfort for the kid 
during a visit to the hospital 
The examples also included problems identifed by the AI-tool in 
relation to the suggested concepts, e.g.: 
Interacting with the AI toy may not be engaging enough 
to keep children occupied for long periods of time

There is no mention of how the platform will handle 
emergency cases where a patient may require immedi-
ate attention 
Some of the generated concept art generated using the AI-based 
image generator (DALL-E 2) are illustrated in Figure 4. 
The core of the analysis of the study is based on the participants’ 
refections and conversations around the design activities and can 
be structured into two main categories. The frst concerns the op-
portunities and challenges that the participants experienced from 
using the AI tool in the design exercises. These bring to the fore 
how they experienced that the AI worked to support certain design 
actions while getting in the way of others. The second category 
concerns the interactional challenges that users faced when using 
the tools and the consequences of these for engaging in meaningful 
and productive design actions. 
4.1 Rapid generation of design alternatives 
The participants identifed a range of diferent practical usages of 
the system such as rapidly generating design alternatives, identi-
fying design problems or creating short scenarios of use around 
various design challenges. Other useful usages the participants 
identifed included things such as creating various forms of check-
lists for things to keep track of in a design project, getting a frst 
set of ideas to start out from, or getting hard-started or inexperi-
enced groups going at an ideation session. Each of these activities 
is time-consuming, but not experienced as particularly complex 
or advanced, refecting what [15] denoted as a way that tools may 
lower friction in design work by simplifying or speeding up the 
process. The possibilities for rapid generation of design ideas that 
the system allowed for, and the large number of potential ideas that 
this could result in was one of the most refected themes among the 
participants. The way we had set up the presets in the system sup-
posedly reinforced this, but due to how easily new queries could be 
posed to the system, it allows for getting immediate responses with-
out any practical limitations. The participants identifed a range 
of diferent strengths and weaknesses in the fact that the 20-30 
new design ideas could be generated in only a few minutes. Several 
participants did not fnd the ideas that were generated to be particu-
larly novel or creative. They were described as being "simplistic" or 
"too straightforward", thereby not providing any value beyond what 
the participants could quickly create on their own. A contrasting 
point of view of several participants regarded a criticism of the 
system for being "too good" at what it does. By generating a large 
number of quite similar ideas, it was claimed that the system would 
run the risk of narrowing the designers’ perspective on a particular 
problem rather than opening up a design space and helping to see 
novel opportunities. 
Despite such scepticism, in the written refections, many partici-
pants discussed the variety of more constructive usages that they 
could envision from the possibilities to rapidly generate a large 
number of design alternatives. Several participants suggested that 
the system could be valuable in order to get rid of "the obvious" or 
"less creative" design ideas, allowing the designers themselves to 
spend less time on design ideas that would not lead in any creative 
directions. This type of interaction is similar to that of specialized 
tools for algorithmic or generative design, which efectively produce 
variants of design concepts by rule-based or random manipulation 
of diferent parameters of a design. As noted by [4], generative 
design can lead to apparently creative outcomes since every new 
combination brings opportunities to look for new emergent prop-
erties or afordances. In refecting on how the rapid and immediate 
generation of new design ideas may infuence a design process, 
some participants discussed how the more slow-paced, refective 
elements of a design process might get lost with the introduction 
and use of tools that instantly can be used to regenerate new ideas 
and propose alternatives design. One participant framed this as a 
need to address the risk that AI tools may counteract how human 
designers often need the time to "slowly and achingly" arrive at the 
key aspects of a design idea and how ideas often grow and change 
overnight, and furthermore, how such slow, refective, refnement 
and articulation of a design idea happen when you move to unusual 
settings, juxtapose ideas with other alternatives, or experiment with 
how an idea would be manifested and experienced in alternative 
design materials [28]. 
4.2 Lack of context and memory 
In contrast to the usefulness of the rapid generation of ideas, an-
other theme that emerged in the refections of the participants 
around the use of the system in the design activities concerned 1) 
the system’s lack of understanding about the context of the design 
problem being worked on, and 2) the system’s lack of memory 
of the unfolding interaction and emerging design concept. As dis-
cussed above, several of the participants found the ideas and issues 
generated by the system to be useful and relevant for the ongoing 
design exercise. However, a number of more critical refections 
pointed to how experiences of the "system’s lack of context" was 
problematic and that ideas and issues identifed about the design 
ideas that were generated "lacked depth". This was formulated in a 
number of ways such as that the system had "no reality check!" or 
that the system was only useful for "going wider, not deeper". Hence, 
the system was experienced as working well to produce quick ideas 
on a topic but not to elaborate or unpack it to any further extent. In 
a related fashion, one participant described this as a "lack of holism" 
in the responses from the system. As the participants used the sys-
tem to explore and dig deeper into one specifc design scenario, 
several participants refected on how the system did not develop 
an understanding of the design idea in a manner that aligned with 
how their own thinking about the idea developed. One participant 
phrased this as experiencing that it was "unclear what it [the system] 
remembers" regarding the ongoing interaction and the design idea 
being developed. While the system often generated design ideas 
in a fashion that one would expect required an understanding of 
the design problem, the participants refected on that there was 
no actual way of knowing if the system repeatedly created new 
ideas from scratch or if these were generated in relation to what 
had been proposed earlier. 
Despite this, several participants talked about how they noted a 
"high understanding from the AI" in its interpretation of the queries 
and the design ideas and problems that it generated. However, in 
order to explore a design space it is critical for designers to know 
the direction of their design process, where they are currently at,

Figure 4: AI-generated concept illustrations, illustrating, a) A game for children where projected bubbles on the foor help

usage, c) and d), a personal digital assistant targeting children and parents, that can answer questions about the hospital record 
where they have been, and where they are headed. This was experi-
enced as problematic by several of the participants that expressed 
that they found the system to be most useful in "searching for ideas" 
or to "generate and probe a variety of diferent perspectives". Clearly, 
at the core of any design efort is to have an understanding of the 
circumstances in which the design work is conducted and to re-
member how the diferent considerations and design choices relate 
to one another. As noted by [4], it becomes hard for computational 
design support to integrate seamlessly with an ongoing design pro-
cess as "designers are able to rapidly identify relevant aspects of a 
problem and constantly shift the direction of design development 
through reformulation, analogy, or co-evolution but receive little or 
no computational support for such behaviour". This also ties into 
the well-established discussion in HCI on the situated nature of hu-
man interaction [30], and the challenges for intelligent systems to 
cope with the contextual nuances and complexities that are always 
at stake in social human activities [23]. 
The participants experienced the lack of contextual understand-
ing and memory as a weakness of the system. However, this prop-
erty was also discussed as a potential resource in the design process, 
in that it would resemble "unrealistic humans" that would propose 
ideas without being limited by what was possible. In a similar vein, 
it was proposed that ."humans should do realism" and that an AI 
system could instead be used to go beyond the expected. 
4.3 Talking to the machine 
Several of the participants highlighted the work of articulating 
instructions to the system as a core part of the design activities. 
Similarly, [15] pointed out how users in natural language interac-
tion with generative machine learning systems experienced that 
they had to develop an understanding of an undefned syntax that 
the system would understand in interacting with it. Our fndings 
suggest how users needed to pay signifcant attention in articu-
lating queries to the system in order to work out ways to get the 
system to respond as they wished or expected. While some experi-
enced that the system required them to spend too much attention 
on the details of formulating such queries, others felt claimed that 
the process helped them "fgure out and fne-tune" their design idea 
within the group. Thus, the interaction had the dual purpose of 
getting the most out of the capabilities of the machine, and at the 
same time to develop and refne defne ideas between the designers 
working together, independently of the responses that the system 
actually provided. 
Furthermore, the participants refected on how the seemingly 
endless number of ideas and alternatives that the system could 
generate after some time of using the system was experienced as 
becoming "similar to googling". One participant mentioned that 
even though the style of interaction was quite diferent to most 
search engines. the activity resembled that of browsing through an 
almost endless number of alternatives in an archive or resembling 
that of traversing similar style video clips on social media platforms. 
As discussed above, the participants got engaged in an ongoing 
refnement process of articulating queries that would result in use-
ful and interesting responses. This involved experimenting with 
various phrasings, and making choices of certain terms or words 
in order to get the system to "understand" what they were aiming 
for. One participant compared this to articulating search terms to 
a database and using flters to delimit between a large number 
of options. The key diference is that the AI system used in this 
study has no predefned syntax or a given set of parameters, but the 
articulation has to be made using natural language. This refects 
Reynolds and McDonell’s [25] discussion of how successful prompt 
programming for large language models instead "entails high-level, 
mentalistic concepts like tone, implication, association, meme, style, 
plausibility, and ambiguity". Furthermore, the participants refected 
on how the reframing of design ideas through a metaphor of search 
would infuence how a designer would understand, interpret and 
make use of the system’s responses to various interactions. Viewing 
the interaction as a form of browsing and searching for ideas in 
a space of available resources, it was suggested, would provide a 
diferent experience of the system than interacting through the 
articulation of open-ended natural language queries, or being in a 
conversation with the system would. Thus, the experience of how 
the system could be used in an interaction design process is shaped 
not only by how well it performs particular tasks such as ideation or 
generating design alternatives, but also by the particular metaphor 
of interaction that the system builds upon.

Design Ideation with AI - Sketching, Thinking and Talking with Generative Machine Learning Models 
DIS ’23, July 10–14, 2023, Pitsburgh, PA, USA 
4.4 Sketching with text and visuals 
Most of the activities in the design exercise relied on text-based 
interaction with the GTP-3 model. One part of the design task, 
required the use of DALL-E 2 image-generation model to generate 
concept illustrations and mood boards for the project. A recur-
ring conversation among the participants concerned the diference 
between text-based and visual interactions. In refecting on the char-
acter of the visualisations and illustrations created by the system, 
several participants pointed to how the seemingly "well-polished" 
character of the visualisation would make it challenging to generate 
alternative designs, as there were no glitches, defects or sketchiness 
that a designer could pick up on to question or challenge various 
aspects of an idea. "I think a problem with the AI generating a vi-
sualization so easily is that you straight away get a narrow view of 
what the solution will look". Some participants however expressed 
a contrasting view in discussions about the diference between a 
visually generated concept idea, vs. a text-based one, where the 
participants argued that the generated images were still more am-
biguous and open for interpretation compared with the, sometimes 
detailed, textual concept suggestions. 
The role played by the particular modality in which the interac-
tion is carried out ties into conversations on the practices of sketch-
ing in ideation and design activities. Sketching has often been put to 
the fore as a foundational activity in all design practices, as a form 
of dialogue where externalizing ideas in written or visual forms 
becomes an integral part of thinking and doing design [9, 14, 17, 27]. 
In a study on the tools that designers use for ideation, Jonson [14] 
shows that most designers use a mix of language-based and visual 
tools, suggesting that design ideation emerges in interaction or 
in conversations between visualisation (non-verbal) and language 
(verbal). That textual interaction is central in the use of large lan-
guage models such as GPT-3 is not surprising, since language and 
text-based modalities are the foundational elements that they are 
built and trained on. In addition, AI models for image generation, 
like DALL-E, are very much dependent on language, and textual 
forms of interaction. During the workshop, some participants ex-
pressed that they would have liked a system that combine text and 
image generation capabilities in one interface. This dependence on 
text and natural language highlights some of the limitations that 
the participants experienced seamlessly shifting between verbal 
and non-verbal forms of sketching. In addition, the participants’ 
accounts on the impact of the "fnishedness" of both visual and tex-
tual outputs from the AI models, point to a tension with sketching 
as a process of engaging with the open-endedness and unfnished 
character of design ideas in the early stages of a design process. 
This refects early studies on the impact of CAD tools on creativity, 
where Lawson and Loke [17] note that "inability of conventional 
CAD drawing tools to sustain ambiguity, uncertainty and parallel 
lines of thought makes them very diferent from manual sketching". 
How large language models and generative image models may 
support various aspects of sketching will thus have to be explored 
further. 
5 DISCUSSION 
Our fndings highlighted both opportunities and challenges for 
integrating large language models in creative design and ideation. 
Here we will focus on three particular issues that we argue are of 
central importance for future developments of AI-based tools to 
support creativity in interaction design processes: Firstly, we discuss 
the characteristics of this kind of computer-supported ideation, in 
comparison with other tools. Secondly, we highlight diferent ways 
of understanding interactions with the system in terms of four kinds 
of interaction metaphors, and why that framing matter. Finally, 
we propose a conceptualization of the interactions with the AI-
tools based perspectives from co-creativity and more-than-human 
design. 
5.1 Design ideation with AI 
Our study shows that the participants saw a range of potentially 
useful ways for integrating and making use of this kind of system in 
design work. This included both speeding up the design process to 
avoid unnecessary time-consuming humps along the way, as well 
as engaging designers in refections and articulations of their ideas, 
helping them see new perspectives and opportunities. Importantly, 
the participants did not fnd the responses from the system to be 
"good" design in itself, but became meaningful in relation to the 
participants’ interpretation of the design task. Not surprisingly, 
no matter how the participants interpreted the intelligibility and 
usefulness of the system, the necessity and importance of human 
refection in these processes were deemed critical. One aspect that 
recurred throughout the workshop was an emphasis on situating 
the actions of the system within a certain context or practice within 
which the participants’ interpretation and sense-making would take 
place. Whatever response the system provided, "human refection" 
and meaning-making were always deemed critical in order for the 
system’s responses to be interpreted as meaningful design actions. 
On several occasions, however, the design ideas that the system 
proposed were described as being "hollow", by lacking reference to 
the intentions and rationales behind the queries articulated by the 
participants. 
This raises a number of concerns regarding how to position these 
kinds of tools in interaction design processes, and how they relate to 
other existing tools and methods designed to support creativity and 
ideation. One issue regards how important the seemingly intelligent 
interaction and human-like communication is for the usefulness of 
such a system. Does the design ideas or design problems that the 
system generates contribute to any substantial degree beyond what, 
for instance, various types of design cards that support designers in 
rapidly envisioning diferent alternatives, perspectives or values? 
While this is a question that needs further empirical work to be 
answered, it highlights the need to further unpack how the various 
actions of an AI tool may play a role in emerging design processes. 
As has been previously noted, existing tools to support creativity 
and ideation are in most cases highly specialized, targeting either 
particular design practices, such as generative CAD tools for in-
dustrial designers, or support for particular design domains. Large 
language models difer through their generic capabilities, while at 
the same time being able to contribute with domain-specifc knowl-
edge. This can be contrasted to card-based approaches, which are 
often generic across settings and contexts, and lack domain-specifc 
knowledge [26]. What became apparent in our fndings was that 
the participants appreciated the more generic reasoning capabilities 
1936
DIS ’23, July 10–14, 2023, Pitsburgh, PA, USA 
Jakob Tholander and Martin Jonsson 
more than the domain-based knowledge support. The system’s abil-
ity to generate design variations or identify problems or challenges 
to a concept solution was considered more useful than the genera-
tion of unique design ideas. Actions and activities involving the AI 
tool that provided a space for interpretation and meaning-making 
were appreciated by the designers, while more "precise" program-
ming style actions, as studied by [15], were more challenging to 
see a use for. 
Another issue that recurred throughout our fndings concerned 
how working with the AI tool on a particular task compared to 
working with another person on the same task. One participant in 
the study argued that the AI system would be most useful when 
working alone, providing a means to engage in an interaction, get-
ting feedback on ideas, and developing them further. The AI system 
would essentially fll the role of another human co-worker. Other 
accounts from the participants, instead lifted that the strengths of 
the AI system lie in its capabilities to go beyond what is possible 
for a human designer, such as generating a large number of ideas 
or variations in a very short time, mirroring what Bernal et al. [4] 
categorize as computer-based actions, aimed at automating and 
speeding up processes. One participant argued that humans should 
"do realism", whereas the AI should contribute with ideas and input 
that are out of reach of the human designers. This type of support, 
Bernal et al. [4] would categorize as computer-augmented actions 
that aim to improve the design quality. Along these lines, the ability 
to provide odd, random or unexpected contributions might cause 
confusion, as well as encourage refection and spur new directions 
of creativity. Albaugh et al [1] argue that this is a particular type 
of support that difers from the time-saving approaches that were 
discussed previously, and instead provides a "time deepening" func-
tion, disrupting the process, and opening up for new avenues of 
thought. 
5.2 Interaction metaphors 
The interaction with the GPT-3 system in this study made use of 
the "Playground" interface, provided by OpenAI. This interface is 
a graphical user interface, where the main interaction element is 
a large text feld, where the user can input text, and where also 
the text generated by the AI appears line by line, and a "Submit" 
button that will initiate the response from the model (see Figure 3). 
This fairly plain interface opens up for several possible interaction 
metaphors, depending on the system’s behaviour. In comparison, 
the more recent ChatGPT interface has a similar design but is 
explicitly presented as a form of chat, based on an interaction 
metaphor most commonly used in human-human communication 
systems, such as text messaging and chatting. In the participants’ 
accounts in our study, they explicitly and implicitly described the 
interactions with the system in relation to other interactive systems 
and forms of interaction, which refect not only diferent ways of 
understanding how the system works, but it also suggests how 
diferent framings of the overall structure of the activity shape 
how the interaction unfolds. In the following, we will discuss four 
diferent interaction metaphors, that could be identifed in our 
data; a) conversation-based metaphor, b) command-based, c) search-
based, and d) chance-based interaction metaphors. Next, we further 
refect on how they infuence the relations and interactions between 
human and technology in interaction design ideation. 
A conversation-based interaction metaphor suggests a conversa-
tion between human and technology, mirroring human-to-human 
dialogues. A signifcant part of the accounts in our fndings refect 
this perspective, attributing subjective characteristics to the AI 
model, for example talking about what it "understands" in the con-
versation, and that "getting to know the AI" was common ways that 
the participants described their ways of interpreting the actions 
of the AI. This refects studies of conversational interfaces [18] 
that point to how users commonly bring expectations on how such 
interaction would be similar to human conversational structures 
[23, 24], and that people (as well as designers) often expect that 
interactions with a machine would unfold in a similar manner as 
human social interaction would, mirroring the assumption that 
a speaker produces meaningful and intelligible utterances in re-
sponse to someone’s actions. Importantly, this has been identifed 
as one of the reasons for the interactional troubles that reoccur in 
interactive systems that attempt to imitate human conversations, 
since the machine inevitably lacks some of the contextual cues that 
human interlocutors typically rely upon in human-to-human inter-
action [30] . This kind of asymmetrical relation to the context of 
the conversation and memory of how it has unfolded was explicitly 
refected in our participants’ conversations around how well the 
system perceived their actions. As pointed out by [23], one reason 
why these troubles arise is that conversational interfaces are sel-
dom designed to allow users to engage in the kind of repair work 
that is at the core of how human conversations unfold. Further, 
our fndings showed how the conversational style of interaction 
shaped the way users interpreted and made sense of the responses 
that the system generated concerning the design exercises, and 
often created a frame of expectations that went beyond what the 
system was actually capable of, illustrated, for instance, by remarks 
from the participants regarding how well the system understood 
the design problem or its interpretation of their queries. 
A more prominent interaction metaphor that can be identifed in 
our data, is an understanding of the AI system as command-based, 
suggesting that you provide a particular instruction to the system 
in order to get a particular response. As has been discussed earlier, 
the users’ work of fguring out a working syntax is a non-trivial 
task in the context of the open natural language interaction with 
large language models, and has been described in terms of prompt 
engineering or prompt programming [25]. Co-creating ideas with 
the AI system in the design exercise was often based on instruc-
tions such as "Propose fve concept ideas on...". Notably, this type 
of interaction is distinctly diferent from the type of direct manipu-
lation interfaces used in most tools designed for sketching and lo-f 
prototyping. The shift from command-based systems with complex 
syntax (e.g. the Emacs text editor), to systems based on physical 
manipulations of graphical elements, was largely driven by the de-
velopment of tools to support creative work such as programming 
and design. 
A related analogy of use that was explicitly brought up by the 
participants, was that the interaction of generating new concept 
ideas resembled that of searching or browsing the internet using 
search engines. The participants highlighted similarities such as 
the natural language interface, through which users may become 
1937

increasingly skilled in formulating search queries, and gets a well-
defned output in response. Furthermore, the participants high-
lighted that the ideation process using the AI system extensively 
involved browsing and sifting among large numbers of more or 
less relevant idea suggestions, which in a sense became a way of 
defning the boundaries of the design space. Framing the activity 
through this kind of use of the large language model mirrors that 
of using systems for generative design of 3D models [21], which 
uses rule-based algorithms to generate design variations, serving 
as inspiration for design [20]. A fnal example of how the system 
was interpreted by the participants, is based on accounts saying 
that they felt that the system responses would sometimes not at 
all correspond to their intentions, providing more or less random 
output, refecting a chance-based interaction. As has been shown in 
earlier studies [15], giving the users something else than what they 
asked for, may actually support creativity, by introducing a form 
of creative friction that encourages refection in action, and open-
ing up for unexpected turns in the design process. Chance-based 
interaction is also foundational in most card-based approaches for 
ideation and creative design in that there is always an element of 
randomness and surprise in the cards someone receives. 
The four interaction metaphors presented above do not form 
an extensive list of all possible ways in which interaction with AI 
could be understood, but the discussion highlights that the common 
conversational interaction metaphor need to be challenged, in order 
to frame and reconfgure what users’ expect from the system in 
relation to what it is actually capable of, as well as how they would 
interpret and understand the actions and responses of the system. 
Conversational or command-based approaches might not be ideal 
interaction forms to support sketching activities, while being better 
suited for design activities that aim at opening up design spaces or 
rethinking problems. 
5.3 Designing with - perspectives on co-creation 
A preceding study [15] on co-creation with AI in creative program-
ming, highlighted how the presentation or "framing" of the tool in 
relation to the activity infuenced the users’ expectations of the sys-
tem’s action and how they valued and interpreted the meaning of 
its responses. In particular, the distinction between understanding 
the AI system as either a tool or as a co-creator was emphasised as 
two alternative ways of framing the interaction in relation to the 
users, and which would foster diferent ways of interpreting its ac-
tions. This aligns with how perspectives such as more-than-human 
design and co-creativity in the last decade have been concerned 
with re-conceptualising the ways novel interactive technologies can 
hold various forms of agency in interactive settings. Notions such 
as material- and machine agency have been introduced in order 
to rethink the actions and relations that emerge when these tech-
nologies become entangled with human users. Importantly, in HCI, 
the notion of machine agency is not about ways of understanding 
how human agency and intelligence is manifested in technology, 
but about how novel forms of agency may expand and co-exist 
with human agency. Such questions of the agential capacities of 
the system were also an overarching issue that appeared through-
out the present study, most prominently through the participants’ 
engagement with the system’s potential to understand various as-
pects of the user’s actions, such as queries to create certain kinds 
of design alternatives, or how imaginative, or creative the system 
was in the responses that were generated. A typical comment from 
the participants was that there was "generally high understanding 
from the AI" or sometimes the opposite "it was not very creative", 
but also in more difuse ways "Sometimes it does whatever it wants, 
but often it feels like it understood things in approximate ways, and 
that it after its best abilities did what it should". 
The users expectations regarding the AI’s capacity for under-
standing and creativity are certainly relevant ways to refect on the 
qualities of a system such as this, but to consider the AI system 
as a co-creative design partner does not require that it displays 
human thinking skills, or that we draw on conceptions such as 
understanding or intelligence in interpreting the value of the sys-
tem’s actions. We fnd that this runs the risk of overshadowing 
more pragmatically oriented considerations of how the qualities of 
the system may be used in design processes, no matter how well 
they refect what we would perceive as human cognitive traits. We 
believe that our fndings challenge several existing conceptualiza-
tions relating to the agential capabilities of interactive systems; 
both the tool perspective, referring to an entirely passive system 
that only carries out the user’s instructions, as well as a perspective 
of intelligent agents, as discussed above. This ties into the con-
versations around any alternative conceptualisations that could 
capture the nuances and complexities involved in the "dance of 
agency" [22] of co-creative settings involving both humans and 
AI tools.. Wakkary’s [35] notion of more-than-human design, and 
specifcally the notion of "designing with" suggests one perspective 
that serves to reconfgure the dichotomous ways of perceiving the 
relations between users and systems, to instead consider design as 
a joint achievement among diferent actors and artefacts. We argue 
that such a perspective on design with general-purpose AI tools, 
provides an opportunity to reframe our perception of the system 
behaviour, in a way that purposefully helps designers to draw on 
and integrate its capabilities in design practices, no matter how 
similar they are to human design skills. This challenge as we see it, 
lies in reframing the space in-between the user and the technology 
in a fashion that helps designers to perceive the tool as able to do 
the things that they cannot do. In other words, this entails framing 
the use and interaction with this kind of system, not as diferent 
ways of seeing how the human and technology can engage in co-
creativity by doing almost the same things, to instead seeing them 
as doing diferent things diferently. 
6 FINAL REMARKS 
In this paper, we have accounted for a small scale study of how large 
language models and generative AI can support creative design and 
ideation. The analysis of the participants’ refections, highlights 
both opportunities and challenges in the interaction and use of 
the system for purposes of design . The opportunities that were 
most clearly identifed, concerned saving time, by quickly map-
ping out a design space, and identifying the most obvious ideas, as 
well as fnding potential faws in various design challenges. The 
participants also saw a potential for generating complementary 
working materials such as scenarios and personas. The participants 
1938

Jakob Tholander and Martin Jonsson 
however did not trust the AI to be able to generate high-quality 
and innovative solutions on its own, pointing to that the system is 
lacking an in-depth contextual understanding of the design case 
and also, the fact that the AI system was perceived as being very 
fast resulted in a view that the system was more useful for going 
wide when exploring a design space, rather than going deep. 
The analysis highlights how the experience of using the system 
was infuenced by the interaction metaphor that the system are 
based upon, and a kind of conversational style of interaction that 
mimic human-to-human communication may work as a resource, 
as well as a hindrance in the design process. The participants ex-
perienced similarities in the interaction with the AI system to that 
of using a search engine. In addition, our fndings suggest that the 
users’ expectations of the systems as being humanly intelligent and 
creative, brings in human-like traits that potentially gets in the way 
of alternative conceptions for design of interfaces and interaction 
for co-creation with AI. To open up for novel alternatives, we have 
argued that post-humanist and more-than-human perspectives on 
design allow for a consideration of machine generated design ac-
tions as creating opportunities to design co-creative settings that 
make better use of the diferent capabilities and characteristics of 
human and machine.
