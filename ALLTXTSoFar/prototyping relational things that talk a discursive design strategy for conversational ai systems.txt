PROTOTYPING RELATIONAL THINGS THAT TALK: 
A DISCURSIVE DESIGN STRATEGY FOR CONVERSATIONAL AI SYSTEMS 
 
Birgitte Aga 
 
 
ABSTRACT 
 
This practice-based research inquiry explores the implications of 
conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, ‘relational things that talk’, on 
the way people experience the world. It responds directly to the pervasive lack of 
ethical design frameworks for commercial AI systems, compounded by limited 
transparency, ubiquitous authority, embedded bias and the absence of diversity 
in the development process.  
The effect produced by relational things that talk upon the feelings, 
thoughts or intentions of the user is here defined as the ‘perlocutionary effect’ of 
conversational AI systems. This effect is constituted by these systems’ 
‘relationality‘ and ‘persuasiveness’, propagated by the system’s embedded bias 
and ‘hybrid intentions’, relative to a user’s susceptibility.  
The proposition of the perlocutionary effect frames the central practice of 
this thesis and the contribution to new knowledge which manifests as four 
discursive prototypes developed through a participatory method. Each prototype 
demonstrates the factors that constitute and propagate the perlocutionary effect. 
These prototypes  also function as instruments which actively engage 
participants in a counter-narrative as a form of activism. ‘This Is Where We Are’ 
(TIWWA), explores the persuasiveness and relationality of relational things 
powered through AI behavioural algorithms and directed by pools of user data. 
 
6 
‘Emoti-OS’, iterates the findings from TIWWA and analyses the construction of 
relationality through simulated affect, personality and collective (artificial) 
emotional intelligence. ‘Women Reclaiming AI’ (WRAI), demonstrates 
stereotyping and bias in commercial conversational AI developments. The last 
prototype, ‘The Infinite Guide’, synthesises and tests the findings from the three 
previous prototypes to substantiate the overall perlocutionary effect of 
conversational AI system. In so doing, this inquiry proposes the appropriation of 
relational things that talk as a discursive design strategy, extended with a 
participatory method, for new forms of cultural expression and social action, 
which activate people to demand more ethical AI systems.

1. Introduction & Overview 
 
“Are you real?” 
“Well if you can’t tell does it matter?” 
(Westworld, 2016) 
 
We are in the midst of a conflux of sophisticated personal, wearable and 
interconnected technologies, powered by increasingly complex Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) systems, interacted with through natural language interfaces. 
These conversational AI systems, relational things that talk, feeding off rivers of 
data springing from our daily activities, are becoming capable of learning, 
anticipating and predicting our next move. The augmented capabilities of these 
systems, realised through technological innovation, renders them capable of 
mediating our perceived reality (Idhe1990; Verbeek 2003, 2005, 2006a, 2006b, 
2008b, 2011). Conjured through the design of systems with human-like attributes, 
reinforced through their immediacy, ubiquity and simulated authenticity, they 
trigger our instinctive ability to humanise things (Turkle, 1984, 2004, 2007a, 
2007b; Fogg and Nass, 1997a, 1997b; Nass, Moon, et al. 1997; Reeves and 
Nass 1999, Weizenbaum 1976). Imbued with the ability to relate to us and make 
use care for them, these artificial systems entice us into their artificial embrace1; 
a grip that is just an illusion. 
 
                                                
1 The term ‘artificial embrace’ is intended as a reference to the work by artist and educator Roy Ascott (1990) 
and his seminal text ‘Is There Love in the Telematic Embrace?’. Here he propose ‘Telematics’ as a term 
describing computer-mediated communications networking involving ‘the technology of interaction among 
human beings and between the human mind and artificial systems of intelligence and perception’ (Ascott, 
2003, p 232).

1.1. Introduction 
 
 
Conversational systems are driven by the commercial pursuit to humanise 
technology for efficient integration and economic gain. By capitalising on 
innovations in Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and oceans of data with a deep 
understanding of human nature, these ‘relational artefacts’ (Turkle, 1984, 2004) 
are optimised to fluidly integrate into our social worlds. The design and 
distribution of AI systems is veiled behind commercial patents and algorithmic 
complexities. This is a process the end consumers are largely left out of, rendered 
voiceless and powerless in the design of systems set to pervasively influence 
their life. With the ubiquitous integration of AI systems across society there is an 
urgency to move beyond efficient user experience design and system integration, 
towards a holistic understanding of the wider impact of these technologies on the 
thoughts, behaviour and actions of their users and society as a whole. 
The design of systems capable of acting as relational things2 goes beyond 
the design of utilitarian products to the conjuring of systems simulating human-
like social qualities capable of relating socially to their users. Inherent in their 
design is the art of illusion; an act, which according to Sharkey and Sharkey 
(2006), brings together the human predisposition to project animacy and 
sentience to objects, with the cultural myths of AI and robotics. This is what 
triggers the public’s active participation in the suspension of disbelief, but at the 
                                                
2 ‘Relational things’ draws a reference to Turkle’s (2004) use of ‘relational artefacts’ and is here 
used to imply artificial systems (virtual or physical, embodied or disembodied) which are designed for social 
interactions with humans, or with other machines. These systems apply human-human communicating 
models, either through conversational interfaces (text or voice) or other forms of embodied interactions (and 
in some cases more abstracted forms of communication). In common they trigger anthropomorphic qualities 
(and in some cases zoomorphic) which exploit the human tendency to interpret technology in terms of the 
social world.  
 
15 
same time this is what drives a commercial design strategy that exploits people’s 
susceptibility to human-like systems. 
   Through the social interactions facilitated by conversational systems; 
‘relational things that talk’ their manufacturers unfold influence and power within 
the social world of their users and society at large. The effects produced by these 
systems upon the feelings, thoughts or intentions of the user, (such as directing, 
persuading, scaring, enlightening, inspiring or dominating), are here described as 
the ‘perlocutionary effect’ of conversational systems. This effect is constituted by 
the ‘relationality’3 and ‘persuasiveness’4 of these systems. The valence of this 
effect on a user is propagated by a system’s hybrid intentions5’ and inherent 
bias6, and relative to a user’s susceptibility. This perlocutionary effect of relational 
things that talk is the central hypothesis of this practice-based research inquiry 
which leads to its contribution to new knowledge.  
The formation of the hypothesis is grounded in the observations of people 
interacting with relational things; chatbots, social robots, home assistants and 
other forms of embodied physical and virtual artefacts. These observations are 
rooted in the practice of the author of this thesis leading up to this point, which is 
                                                
3 The ‘relationality’ of things that talk is here defined as the ability of conversational systems with human-
like attributes to form relations with their users through triggering the human tendency to project human 
characteristics on non-human things and apply their social communication frameworks within these 
interactions. 
4 To support the notion that that all interactive technologies has a level of influence and persuasion the term 
the ‘persuasiveness’ of conversational systems will here be used to distinguish if from Fogg’s (1998, 1999) 
term ‘persuasive technologies’. It is here intended as a term which describes the ability of a technological 
systems to influence a user to achieve its system goal. Persuasiveness is here recognised as an integral 
design tool for successful user experience design and pervasively applied across technology product and 
service design.  
5 The ‘hybrid Intentions of things’ is here proposed as the confluence of the declared and undeclared 
intentions of the manufactures and the designers of the systems, with the intentions of the users of the 
systems (in terms of how and why they use the system). 
6 The application of the term bias follows Madhu’s (2018) definition as; ‘the systematic differences between 
samples and a population as it pertains to model precision (predictive value, false positives) and recall 
(sensitivity, false negatives).’ `It is closely related to the influence of human bias within computational 
systems (through data and computational models)  reinforcing stereotyping and other forms of mis-
representation.

situated across art, design and research, and which is intentionally collaborative 
and participatory. It is infused and influenced by the author being the lead partner 
and creative practitioner of the i-DAT Collective7. A role, which since 2001, has 
grounded what is essentially a prototyping practice which centres on 
experimentation with relational AI technologies. This legacy informs the 
theoretical development of the hypothesis of the perlocutionary effect of 
conversational systems described in chapter two which is tested and synthesised 
through the practice-based inquiry described in chapter three. This practice 
manifests as four discursive8 prototypes (documented in the attached digital 
portfolio) which are developed through a participatory9 method. Each prototype 
iterates the findings from the previous and explores, demonstrates, analyses and 
synthesises the factors that constitute and propagate the perlocutionary effect, at 
the same time functioning as instruments actively engage participants in a 
counter-narrative as a form of activism: 
 
This is Where We Are (TIWWA): 
 
The first prototype, TIWWA (see figure 1 and 2) explores the 
persuasiveness and relationality of relational things powered through AI 
behavioural algorithms and directed by pools of user data.  
 
                                                
7 The i-DAT Collective is a lab for ‘playful experimentation with creative technology’ (i-DAT, 2018). It consists 
of two entangled parts; i-DAT Research and the i-DAT Collective. The Collective, an interdisciplinary group 
of technologist, artists, designers and researcher, develops work manifesting as a range of public projects 
(boundary-fluid art works, interventions, systems and cultural prototypes). In common they all apply and 
explore emergent technologies and their relationship to new cultural forms and social impact. 
8 The term ‘discursive design’ follows Tharp and Tharp’s (2013, pp. 406-407) description as the practice of 
creating  ‘…utilitarian objects/services/interactions whose primary purpose is to communicate ideas—
artifacts embedded with discourse. These are tools for thinking; they raise awareness and perhaps 
understanding of substantive and often debatable issues of psychological, sociological, and ideological 
consequence’.  
9 The use of the term ‘participatory design’ is applied as with a political and ideological dimension linking it 
to the roots in empowerment and democratisation born out of Scandinavia in the 1960s. It centres on 
enhancing the agency of the user in the design process by their active cooperation (Malpass 2016; DiSalvo, 
2012). 
 
17 
  
Emoti-OS: 
The second prototype, Emoti-OS (see figure 3 and 4), iterates the findings 
from TIWWA and analyses the construction of the relationality of conversational 
systems, delving deeper into the influence of simulated affect, personality and 
collective (artificial) emotional intelligence.  
 
 
Women Reclaiming AI (WRAI): 
The third prototype, WRAI (see figure 5 and 6), demonstrates stereotyping 
and bias in commercial conversational AI developments. It differs from the others 
in that it explicitly investigates the lack of diversity in this development process 
through actively engaging participants as a form of activism.

The Infinite Guide: 
Lastly, The Infinite Guide (see figure 7 and 8) synthesises and tests the 
findings from the three previous prototypes to substantiate the overall 
perlocutionary effect of conversational AI system. In so doing, this inquiry 
proposes the appropriation of relational things that talk as a discursive design 
strategy, extended with a participatory method, for new forms of cultural 
expression and social action, which activate people to demand more ethical AI 
systems.

1.2. Key terms 
The following is intended as an description of key terms used within this 
thesis. Other terms and related definitions less fundamental to the practice are 
outlined where appropriate within the text or footnotes: 
 
Artificial, intelligence and artificial intelligence  
The reference to ‘artificial’ is here intended as opposed to natural. It implies 
binary as the material of construction and digital components as its 
facilitator. The use of the term follows Herbert Simon’s (1996, p.5) 
distinction proposed in ‘The Sciences of the Artificial’ as the following: 
1. Artificial things are synthesized (though not always or usually with 
full forethought) by human beings.  
2. Artificial things may imitate appearances in natural things while 
lacking, in one or many respects, the reality of the latter.  
3. Artificial things can be characterized in terms of functions, goals, 
adaptation.  
4. Artificial things are often discussed, particularly when they are 
being designed, in terms of imperatives as well as descriptives. 
 
The notion of intelligence is here intended in the context of the artificial 
defined by Nilsson (2010, p13) as ‘that quality that enables an entity to 
function appropriately and with foresight in its environment’. This is 
extended with Michael Negnevitsky’s (2005, p.3) definition as ‘the ability 
to learn and understand, to solve problems and to make decisions’. This 
underpins the description of the term Artificial intelligence (AI) used within 
the context of this research as being concerned with the ability of artificial 
systems to learn, understand, problem solve and behave appropriately in 
its environment10.  
                                                
10 The application of AI through Machine learning (ML), where systems are capable of automatically learning 
and improving from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so (Nandu, 2018), is what enables 
 
20 
 
Conversational AI systems  
For the purpose of this inquiry ‘conversational AI systems’ (conversational 
systems) are defined in the broadest sense, encompassing a continuum 
of artificial systems designed to conduct dialog interactions (voice and / or 
text) with humans, such as; chatbots, personal voice assistants or social 
robots. The focus is on any system, embodied (physical or virtual) or 
disembodied, that has natural language processing capabilities 
underpinned by AI technologies (Machine Learning and Deep Learning), 
and that can be said to attempt to simulate human-like social 
communication frameworks. The focus is on what they trigger within their 
human users, (how they are perceived and related actions, thoughts and 
behaviour), rather than their wider functionality and capabilities. This starts 
to describe an alternative approach to the design of these systems, where 
the starting point is the potential effect these systems may have on their 
users, and whether or not this is desirable (for the individual and society 
as a whole). 
 
Discourse 
The use of the term ‘discourse’ follows Tharp and Tharp’s (2019, p. 24) 
description ‘as a system of thought and knowledge’ which they distinguish 
from the ‘conversational idea of discoursing’. It is grounded in Foucault’s 
writing on the notion of discourse, framed by Weedon (1987, p. 108) as 
                                                
the majority of digital services from such as; Facebook news feeds, Netflix recommendations, Amazon 
product listings, to conversations with your Google Assistant. ML with natural language understanding, 
connectivity and increased processing is powering the ubiquity of conversational interfaces which are 
explored in this thesis. 
 
21 
‘ways of constituting knowledge, together with the social practices, forms 
of subjectivity and power relations which inhere in such knowledges and 
relations between them… They constitute the 'nature' of the body, 
unconscious and conscious mind and emotional life of the subjects they 
seek to govern’. The application of discourse is here framed as a way of 
constituting knowledge which attempts to define and re-define the reality 
of the social world of the individuals and things it envelopes. 
 
Reality  
This enquiry is framed within a view of reality as being socially defined as 
a subjective experience of everyday life rather than an objective reality of 
the natural world. It follows the ideas proposed by Berger and Luckmann 
(1966), (and supported and further developed by such as Burr (2003) and 
Leeds-Hurwitz, (2009), that reality is always socially defined and that 
conversation is the most important means of maintaining, modifying and 
reconstructing these subjective realties and knowledge itself. The intention 
within this thesis is not to enter the long-standing relativism versus realism 
debate or the existence or otherwise of an objective reality, but to explore 
the role of other individuals and artefacts in mediating the way in which we 
interpret, share, construct and reconstruct our subjective reality. The 
concern lies with what Berger and Luckmann (1966, p.37) describe as the 
reality of ‘everyday life’; the reality that stands out as the ‘paramount 
reality’ as it ‘imposes itself upon consciousness in the most massive, 
urgent and intense manner’ (ibid. p.37). This reality is therefore taken for 
 
22 
granted as reality, and is constructed through communicating with others 
about the experience of it.  
 
Things 
Binder et al. (2011, p.2) propose, in their book ‘Design Things’, that the 
challenge of design today is no longer about designing things in terms of 
objects or an ‘entity of matter’, but a thing as ‘a sociomaterial assembly 
that deals with matters of concern’ (ibid, p.2). They describe things as 
constituting the ‘…everyday fabric for experiencing and making sense of 
the world’ and that this is how we ‘.. develop our skills in language and 
embodied action by actively relating to and engaging with them’ (ibid, pp. 
51-52). The term things here implies that they are artefacts for interaction 
which open up new ways of thinking and behaving. Here things are active 
mediators; influencing how ‘humans are present in their world and how the 
world is present to them’; shaping both our subjectivity and objectivity 
(Verbeek, 2005, p. 235). This turn towards things as a way to interpret the 
world is central to the exploration in this thesis.  
 
Relational things that talk 
The term here coined as ‘relational things that talk’ is part of the 
contribution to new knowledge and imply artificial systems (virtual or 
physical, embodied or disembodied) which are designed for social 
interactions with humans, or with other machines. It encompasses the 
 
23 
following terms (and version of these); conversational interface11, 
conversational agent, conversational AI system (conversational system) 
and conversational artefacts. Relational things that talk are artificial 
systems (virtual or physical, embodied or disembodied) capable of 
conducting human dialog (text or voice) through natural language 
processing (NLP) interfaces. These systems encourage people to apply 
their understanding of social relationships to their human-machine 
interactions, and have the potential to influencing the way in which users 
perceive their social reality.  
 
The perlocutionary effect  
The ‘perlocutionary effect’ of conversational systems, of relational things 
that talk, is the central contribution to new knowledge within this practice-
based inquiry and the term coined to describe the hypothesis put forth. 
The perlocutionary effect is the sum of their influence on a users’ actions, 
thoughts, or beliefs. This effect is here proposed to be propagated through 
a system’s relationality, and persuasiveness, and its valance (its positive, 
natural and negative effect) influenced though their embedded bias and 
hybrid intentionality. These factors of influence are constructed through 
the design of their systems functions; personality design, personalisation, 
conversational ability, affective functions and embodied functions.  They 
are further amplified through the choice of technology and distributing 
                                                
11 McTear et al. (2016, p. 11), in ‘The Conversational Interface: Talking to Smart Devices’ use the term 
conversational interface to refer to ‘..technology that supports conversational interaction […] by means of 
speech and other modalities’. The meaning of the term used here also includes ‘conversational systems’,  
‘personal assistants’, ‘voice assistants’, ‘chatbots’ as well as embodied conversational interfaces, such as 
robots, to encompass all systems which falls within the definition above. 
 
24 
platforms and compounded by a user’s susceptibility. This leads to the 
central exploration of this thesis around the mediating and reality forming 
influence of conversational systems on a user. 
 
 
1.3. Methodological approach 
 
This research inquiry centres on creative practice as a primary method of 
knowledge development. Following the definition by Candy (2006, p.1) this is 
essentially a practice-based research inquiry, where the ‘creative artefact is the 
basis of the contribution to knowledge’. However, this inquiry also leads to new 
understandings that has operational significance for this practice, which could be 
described as practice-led outcomes (ibid). As the primary basis of the contribution 
to knowledge is rooted in creative artefact, this thesis will use the term practice-
based to describe its research inquiry.  
The overall theoretical approach of this practice-based research inquiry is 
grounded 
in 
people’s 
experience 
and 
therefore 
framed 
through 
a 
postphenomenological perspective. It applies the work of Ihde’s (1990) and 
Verbeek (2003, 2005, 2006a, 2006b, 2008b, 2011) to frame the inquiry into the 
role technology plays in everyday human experience and its effect on people’s 
existence and their relation with the world (and others). Through applying a 
philosophy of technology lens, directed by Verbeek’s (2005) theory of mediation, 
this inquiry proposes technologies as active mediators in relations between 
humans and their reality. This approach informs the central hypothesis of this 
thesis; the perlocutionary effect of conversational AI systems on a user’s 
 
25 
perception of their social reality, and related thoughts, behaviours and actions. 
To further contextualise the influence of language and conversations within 
interactions with these systems, the research by Berger and Luckmann (1966) 
on the reality generating potency of language and the performative function of 
language by Austin (1962) and Searle (1969) is also applied. 
The practice-based inquiry of this research is formed around four 
speculative prototypes (relational things that talk) ‘TIWWA’, ‘Emoti-OS’, ‘Women 
Reclaiming AI’ and ‘The Infinite Guide’, to explore the impact of conversational 
systems on the social reality of their users. Central to this practice is the 
requirement of participation to elicit engagement with the public (users / 
technology consumers) as co-designers, in order to incorporate their views, 
concerns and opinions into the design process. Rather than facilitating 
monologues to be experienced at a distance, this practice proposes to act upon 
these realities by creating participatory and dialogue-driven speculative 
experiences. These experiences are facilitated through the conversational AI 
technologies the prototypes, and related scenarios and artefacts, this practice-
based inquiry critique. Through this process of doing practice with people as 
participants and collaborators the ambition is to increase their engagement with 
and therefore impact of the discourse put forth. The evaluation of the practice 
outlined within this thesis and assessing its impact is rooted in its intention to 
create actual and traceable participation in the proposed discourse. 
 
1.3.1. The discourse of discursive design and related fields 
The practice of this inquiry situates itself within the broader interpretation of 
discursive design proposed by Tharp and Tharp (2019) in their recent publication 
 
26 
‘Discursive design: Critical, Speculative and Alternative Things’.  They describe 
this term as a genius for design approaches (as illustrated in figure 9) which 
embed artefacts with discourse to illicit discussion. A process they (ibid, p. 102) 
describe as ‘discourse-through-design’ following a process of co-creation, 
dissemination, reception and response. Here ‘utilitarian objects / services / 
interactions’ are created ‘whose primary purpose is to communicate ideas—
artefacts embedded with discourse’ (2013, p 406-407). These are ‘tools for 
thinking; they raise awareness and perhaps understanding of substantive and 
often debatable issues of psychological, sociological, and ideological 
consequence’ (ibid). 
The proposition of discursive design as an umbrella category put forward 
by Tharp and Tharp is a useful way to frame an approach that accounts for the

varied forms and methods imbued within a critical practice or instantiations that 
engage other forms of speculation, research, or commerce. The design of the 
practice described within this thesis is aligned with Tharp and Tharp’s proposition 
underlining a unity of design approaches through their concern with a level of 
intellectual impact; ‘using its artefacts not for utilitarian or aesthetic ends but 
communicatively and to get its audiences and users to reflect upon certain ideas’ 
(2019, p. 344). The practice-based research described here applies aspects of 
the following design approaches incorporated within the discursive design genus; 
critical design12, speculative design13, adversarial design14, design fiction15 and 
design as activism16.  
This practice intentionally does not situate itself neatly within specific 
design categories, or within forms of art, social movement or activism, but across 
these arenas. Any assertion of a clear authoritative distinction between art and 
design is not productive for the research exploration and practice conducted here 
                                                
12 The conceptualisation of ‘critical design’ was first introduced by Gaver and Dunne in the paper ‘The Pillow: 
Artist Designers in the Digital Age’ (1997), and proliferated through Hertzian Tales by Dunne (1999) and 
Design Noir by Dunne and Raby (2001). However Tharp and Tharp (ibid) highlight that their initial definition 
has become increasingly distorted - from a focus on electronic objects that could not exist in the marketplace 
with the goal of ‘enlightenment and emancipation’ - to a wider, less technology-focused practice not always 
embracing the central tool of irony.   
13 Speculative design’ is described by Dunne and Raby (2013,pp.  2-3) as an act; ‘…creating an idea of 
possible futures’ using ‘...design as a medium to stimulate discussion and debate amongst designers, 
industry and the public about the social, cultural and ethical implications of existing and emerging 
technologies’ (ibid, p.3). They do not propose this as a formal design method but as an approach to 
speculating how things could be and by doing so enter a process of ‘..collectively redefining our relationship 
to reality’ (ibid). 
14 DiSalvo (2012, pp. 1-2) describes ‘adversarial design’ as a type of political design which straddles ‘the 
boundaries of design and art, engineering and computer science, agitprop and consumer products’ and 
‘spans a range of audiences and potential users and falls under various labels, such as critical design and 
tactical media’. It is a type of cultural production that employ design in an adversarial manner doing the work 
of agonism ‘through the conceptualization and making of products and services and our experiences with 
them’. 
15 The term ‘design fiction’ was originally coined by the Science Fiction author Bruce Sterling (2005), and 
further extended and applied by Bleecker (2009, p. 6) as ‘a conflation of design, science fact, and science 
fiction’. This approach places a strong emphasis on technological futures and the use of fictional 
scenarios. 
16 The notion of design as activism or ‘design activism’ draws a reference to Fuad-Luke’s (2009, p. 27) 
publication ‘Design activism: beautiful strangeness for a sustainable world’’ where he describes this as 
‘design thinking, imagination and practice applied knowingly or unknowingly to create a counter-narrative 
aimed at generating and balancing positive social, institutional, environmental and/or economic change’. 
 
28 
(and arguably also not for the wider impact of discursive work (Coles, 2007; 
DiSalvo, 2012; Tharp and Tharp, 2019)). Instead of carving distinctions between 
these fields, the practice described within this thesis draws inspiration from work 
by artist and designers that appropriates emergent technologies to engage the 
general public in a discourse which reflects on human-machine realities. 
Collectively these works, which are described further in chapter three, start to 
describe, cross reference, inform and underpin a territory for a practice 
appropriating relational things that talk as a discursive design strategy to inform 
the design of future conversational AI systems. The priority is here placed on 
designing a participatory discourse reflective of this context and which is 
responsive to the people taking part.  
Whereas this practice here described does not follow Dunne and Raby’s 
critical and speculative design practice, it does ground itself in their (2013, p. 6) 
call to action;  
We believe that by speculating more, at all levels of society, and exploring 
alternative scenarios, reality will become more malleable and, although 
the future cannot be predicted, we can help set in place today factors that 
will increase the probability of more desirable futures happening. 
 
It embraces their use of scenarios and ‘what-if question’ as a starting point to; 
‘…open up spaces of debate and discussion.. and wonder about how things could 
be’ (ibid, 2013, p.3). By inviting participants to envision, co-create and experience 
discursive scenarios and artefacts with and through conversational AI systems, it 
attempts to activate their engagement with this discourse. At the same time also 
activating their ability to question and challenge the design of commercial AI 
powered systems and services. The discursive artefacts are here designed as 
functional technological prototypes, not as symbolic props, to enable real human-
 
29 
machine interactions rather than simulations of these emergent relationships. 
Prototyping is here a tool for generating discourse about, with and through the 
conversational systems it critiques. By offering ‘real’ interaction, (opposed to 
artefacts viewed at a distance), it attempts to trigger the human-machine relations 
the practice is attempting to critique as a space for reflection and a call for social 
action. 
 
1.3.2. A participatory method 
The prototyping practice described within this thesis, (and further outlined 
in Appendix I: Collaborative Prototyping), applies a method of participation in its 
design. The use of participation is not only a method of developing the practice, 
but a direct ideological and political reference to the roots of participatory design 
born out of Scandinavia in the 1960s. This centres on empowerment and 
democratisation, enhancing the agency of the user in the design process by their 
active cooperation (Malpass 2016; DiSalvo, 2012). This practice embraces the 
potential of democratic values in the design process and prioritises users (of AI 
technologies) as key stakeholders, emphasising that those affected by the design 
of a technologically mediated future should have a say in the process and 
therefore participate as co-designers. The act of participation is simultaneously 
an act of empowerment to activate users of AI technologies to demand more 
desirable and representative systems. 
This method of participation embrace what Schuler and Namioka (1993) 
propose as a process of engaging participants’ imagination rather than seeing 
them as mere respondents or as agents to observe and generate data from. This 
is a response to the criticism of ‘people-centred’ approaches, (such as human-
 
30 
centred’ design, user-centred’ design, participatory design, co-creation and 
critical design) for not properly enabling an approach to address expanded social 
relationships, as argued by Donahue (2014). In particular, he states (ibid, p. 42), 
that this is true for those ‘directly confronting issues and relationships of power, 
access, authority, gender, race, socio-economics, and the multitude of agendas 
and affiliations in a global context of policy or systemic engagement’. Across all 
of these approaches within a commercial context there is a pursuit of gaining 
insights; habits, preferences, aspirations, and values, either directly around 
consumer product or specific service relationships.  Instead Donahue (2014, p. 
41) calls for a;  
‘move beyond a product or service orientation and develop a language 
and understanding of how to participate in and contribute to the politics, 
scale, and sustainability of power, authority, and access across multiple 
social agendas and positions.’ 
 
Instead the design and manifestation of the prototyping practice described 
here draws a reference to social practice art (social practice). This 
interdisciplinary field of research and practice that integrates experimental 
aesthetic movements with the traditions of social science and social theory. It is, 
according to Jackson (2007), applied across a number of movements in 
experimental art and performance studies (activist art, protest performance, 
community art, relational aesthetics, and conversation pieces). It signals a social 
turn in art practice. Sholette et al. (2018, p.21) describes this as a ‘collaborative, 
collective, and participatory social method for bringing about real-world instances 
of progressive justice, community building, and transformation’. This form of 
 
31 
practice engages with the broader social world, and is ‘conversational, 
interactive, temporal, and performative’ (ibid, p.2).  
The practice here described aligns with Coombs (2014) description of 
social practice as ‘relational acts’ that involve interactions between artists and 
audiences. It also designs a process that is collaborative, collective, and 
participatory to engage audiences as participants in the making/creation of the 
‘piece’. It shares a kinship with social practice, but it does not describe itself as 
social practice. Whereas these interventionist acts are often activist in nature and 
usually occur in public spaces and unconcerned (or less so about the artefact 
produced), the prototyping practice here developed, is concerned about both the 
process and the artefact; the discursive system and scenario. It is focused on 
applying computational technologies, in particular AI systems, both as a context 
and as a material and focus of production. It also distinguishes itself that the 
participatory making process does not take place in the public domain, but the 
interactions with the co-created discursive prototypes.     
It is here recognised that some design approaches that fall within Tharp 
and Tharp’s overarching term of discursive design apply forms of participation. 
However, these are largely designed as interactions with pre-designed discursive 
scenarios and artefacts. It is far less common, as Tharp and Tharp (2019, p.273) 
outline, with forms where the audience is ‘engaged somehow in the creation or 
fabrication of the objects themselves’. This practice-based inquiry therefor aims 
to challenge and insert, as an ideological and political move, audiences of cultural 
artefacts and users of AI technologies back into the design process to create 
more representative future speculations and current realities.

1.3.3. Acknowledging contributions within a participatory practice 
Within the practice outlined in this thesis the author performs the role of 
artist-designer-producer-collaborator. This role is reflective of being a woman 
creating technology driven artefacts in a sector largely dominated by men, where 
priority is given to modes of ownership, authority and competitiveness. The 
author has in response developed an intentional and idealistic design strategy, 
rooted in an open source culture17, which centres on shared ownership, 
distributed authorship, inclusion, trust and diversity. Within this process the 
contribution of each participant is regarded as having equal value, irrelevant of 
experience (life or professional), skills and measurable inputs (time and 
resources).  
This approach sits uncomfortably within a commercial, artistic and 
academic  environment, where value and benefits are often attributed to the 
individual who claims the role as developer, artist or scientist. The author actively 
rejects the notion of claiming these for individual reward. However, she does 
recognise the necessity of describing her contribution within the framework of this 
academic thesis. This act sits unresolved within the ideological framework of the 
practice, but is proposed to be mitigated by simply describing rather than claiming 
or evaluating these contributions.  
The creative and novel act within this practice is as much the initiation and 
creative production of participation and collaboration itself, as the development  
of the artistic ideas and the underpinning research inquiry. Whilst the author’s 
contribution as the co-author (TIWWA, Women Reclaiming AI and Emoti-OS) and 
                                                
17 The notion of open source is inherently intertwined with a way of developing technologies and software. 
However within this thesis it is used to imply an open source culture which goes beyond the ethos of sharing 
and reusing code and software, to ‘an ethos that values sharing’ (Hecht, 2018). This indicates an ideological 
culture which embrace collaboration, community, meritocracy and collective benefits..

author (The Infinite Guide) of the artistic ideas, and the instigator of the research 
inquiry, the value lies in the impact produced collectively by all participants in the 
practice, irrelevant of their individual contributions. Through this way of working, 
a non-hierarchical, collaborative and equal process of developing work is 
initiated, where the credit, ownership and authorship lies with all participants, 
increasing its potential for social impact. 
 
1.3.4. The evaluation of practice and assessment of impact 
The evaluation of the practice outlined within this thesis and assessing its 
impact is measured against the central aim of creating actual and traceable 
participation in the proposed discourse. It is framed through the exploration of the 
potential impact of appropriating relational things that talk as a discursive design 
strategy through a participatory method. The ambition is that this empowers 
participants (and audiences) to (re)evaluate and (re)consider their current and 
future expectations of and relationship with conversational AI systems, and their 
voice in the commercial design of AI technologies overall. With the engagement 
with discourse being the fundamental goal and desired outcome of the practice 
this is what is reflected upon and critiqued through the description of the 
prototyping process in chapter three. Tharp and Tharp (2019, p. 285) propose 
that audience reflection is the ‘baseline requirement’ for successful discursive 
design, and only after this can one start to explore any potential impact (societal, 
business, professional and personal). They (ibid, p. 286) are ultimately more 
concerned with ‘...discursive designers having an impact than in measuring 
impact’, but underline the potential societal impact a discursive approach could 
have; 
 
34 
 
So first, discursive design can have a societal impact, which is the 
broadest arena with many branches and involves collectives and their 
thinking, actions, artifacts, and organization. This includes stakeholders, 
partners, users and audiences that were known to be part of the process, 
but it also includes those affected by the unknowable ripples that extend 
into society.  
 
Simultaneously Tharp and Tharp (2019, p. 285) recognise the challenge in 
measuring such an impact, which often can be intrinsic or indirect, due to ‘latency, 
unintended consequences, variable contexts, and false indicators’. They (ibid, p. 
289) state that though discursive design ‘always strives for mental responses 
from the audience, they only sometimes shoot for, let alone achieves, any 
broader impact’. This is not as they (ibid) say ‘audience satisfaction business’, 
but about inviting people to ‘encounter, inspect, recognize, decipher, interpret and 
reflect’ on the discourse embedded.  
The practice discussed in this thesis does not imply that audience 
engagement with a discursive prototype will lead to societal change. It does 
however argue that by engaging people through participatory methods in the 
design process one can, as the designer of this discourse, better engage people 
and at the same time, better evaluate and interpret this engagement and impact. 
This argument, for the role of real (opposed to a token) user participation in the 
design process, is simultaneously posed as an essential part of a design process 
for future AI systems and services. The agenda around participation is therefore 
central to the evaluation of the practice and impact. Simultaneously the practice 
also speculates if the role of the designer and conveyor of this discourse could 
be augmented by the application of conversational systems as conveyors of 
discourse.  
 
35 
The evaluation of the practice consisting of the four prototypes, TIWWA, 
Emoti-OS, WRAI and The Infinite Guide, is grounded in its pursuit to develop 
participatory discourse about the topic of investigation. It is focused on the 
potential impact of extending a discursive design approach with a participatory 
method to deepen engagement with the proposed discourse. Simultaneously the 
function of the practice is to apply, test and expand the theoretical investigation 
of the perlocutionary effect of conversational systems. These aspects frame the 
methods applied to evaluate and validate their impact. The evaluation of the 
practice itself is rooted in the intentions and context of the specific prototypes, 
underpinned by the institutional collaborations and contexts, and validated 
through these partnerships, dialogue with participants and audiences, and public 
presentations and publications of the work (for a full list of exhibitions, conference 
presentations and publications please see the Appendix ‘Public Research 
Outputs’). 
The process of evidencing and assessing the impact of the practice 
through dialogue with participants and audiences is conducted through informal 
conversations, focus groups conducted by the designer of this discourse and 
collaborators (applied across TIWWA, Emoti-OS and WRAI), and through using 
the conversational systems it is critiquing to engage (applied across TIWWA, 
Emoti-OS and WRAI) and evaluate this engagement (applied within The Infinite 
Guide). Here the participation in the design process and in dialogue with the 
designer of the discourse is in itself a documentation of impact. This aligns with 
Tharp and Tharp’s (2019, p. 286) concern with ‘having an impact’ rather than 
‘measuring impact’. This intentionally declares a distance from contemporary 
audience evaluation metric enforced by funders within the cultural sector as well 
 
36 
as the user satisfactory surveys of commercial sector. The interest lies in 
documenting participation with the design and discourse as an act of 
empowerment, reclaiming the voice of audience / end-users within a discursive 
and commercial design process. This pursuit influenced the design decisions 
made within the practice, as well as the type of collaboration and participation 
facilitated. The manifestation of the participation with the discourse at the same 
time became generated through the real-time dialogues between people and the 
conversational AI systems. Taking on its own narrative as an emergent and 
generative discourse between humans and systems. 
The type of evaluation applied is a direct output from the intentions of the 
project and the context (participants, collaborator, partners, as well as the framing 
of the discourse framing and site) of the work. TIWWA was the first manifestation 
of the central research inquiry to test the hypothesis of the perlocutionary effect 
of conversational systems and the process of participation itself. The evaluation 
of this prototype and documentation of its impact was explored through informal 
observations where participation in the design process and in dialogue with the 
designer of the discourse is the documentation of impact. Emoti-OS explored the 
relationality of affective systems and was also focused around evaluating the 
impact of a participatory method to increase engagement with the discourse put 
forward. Lead through participatory workshops, engagement was again 
documented through participation in these, and further through informal feedback 
from participants and focus groups lead by the Plymouth School of Creative Arts 
(PSCA) project lead. The wider audience/participant engagement with the Emoti-
OS’ was documented, observed and evaluated through interactions with its 
 
37 
scenario and artefacts (conversational data and number of interactions) and 
informal observations of audience/user.  
The evaluation of WRAI was rooted in its intention to focus on generating 
discourse with participants, (rather than with audiences engaged through public 
presentations of work) around stereotyping and bias in commercial 
conversational AI developments. This was facilitated through informal 
conversations through doing, as participation in prototyping workshops, as well 
as through reflecting on the participatory process with the collaborators. The 
intention was to create a conversational and informal workshop space where no 
personal data was collected and participants where free to share their thoughts. 
The evaluation of the Infinite Guide referenced the evaluation methods and 
findings deployed across the previous prototype iterations. It further extended this 
process by conducting observations of users’ engagement with discourse 
through the system itself (conversational data and number of interactions), as 
well as evaluating the participatory process through focus groups, public 
presentations and informal conversations.  
The practice outlined in this thesis incorporates the ambition of exploring 
the application of conversational AI systems to instigate discourse through 
conversations with their users, as well as to evaluate their interactions (not as 
facilitators for data-harvesting, but for facilitators of discourse). A process not 
intended to provide user satisfaction or audience evaluation data of their art / 
cultural experience, but to use the method of evaluation as additional layer of 
interactions generate discourse around people’s relationship with AI systems. 
Though some of these methods are commonly deployed to measure user 
experience and audience satisfaction in commercial design and across the arts 
 
38 
and culture, the intention here is not to gather such data. A pursuit which often 
conflicts with cultural organisations and funders drive for audience evaluation 
metrics to justify their funding spend and the intrinsic value of art and culture.  
The practice-based research inquiry of this thesis is interested in peoples’ 
engagement with its discourse. This does however not disregard the 
responsibility of the quality of interactions and the impact on the audience when 
interacting with the artefacts and scenarios presented here. However, it is about 
exploring the making of things that talk as participatory practice, as well as a 
conversation with these things as a form of critical discourse. The intention is to 
apply and test the knowledge generated on existing conversational AI systems to 
describe and synthesise a deeper understanding of their impact on the thoughts, 
behaviour and actions of their users and society as a whole. By doing so it aims 
to propose a more ethical design framework for future conversational systems 
 
 
1.4. Research questions; beliefs, desires, aims and objectives 
 
The practice-based research inquiry of this thesis is driven by the author’s 
desire to claim technological innovation for artistic production and social 
action, with the people that these technologies will affect. It seeks to unmask 
the complexity of conversational AI systems, challenging the pervasive lack of 
ethical design frameworks and diversity; limited transparency; ubiquitous 
authority and embedded bias in their development. Central to this aim is the 
design of actual and traceable participation through a practice that develops a 
counter-narrative as a form of activism. These aims are underpinned by the belief 
that only by including, activating and empowering the people that AI systems 
 
39 
(and other emergent technologies) affect, can one start to demand more ethical 
and desirable future technologies.  
This practice-based inquiry is directed through the above aims and 
extended by drawing a parallel between the lack of user participation in 
technology development to a similar lack of participation in many discursive 
design paradigms (outlined further in the methodology section below). It 
responds to the following criticism of discursive design approaches; lack of 
dialogue and follow-up debate (Kerspern, 2015) and the presence of elitist and 
privileged positions incorporated within their scenarios and artefacts 
(Tonkinwise, 2015).  
These desires, beliefs and aims underpin the research questions of this 
inquiry. The first question forms a foundation for the contribution of new 
knowledge through the hypothesis of the perlocutionary effect of conversational 
systems:  
How do conversational AI systems, relational things that talk, 
influence the subjective reality and related thoughts, behaviours and 
actions of their users? 
 
This question is focused on building a theoretical foundation to understand what 
impact conversational AI systems may have on the social reality of an individual 
user. By developing the proposition of the perlocutionary effect, it describes the 
factors of influence which constitute and propagate this effect (their relationality 
and persuasiveness, embedded bias and hybrid intentions). Through commercial 
examples, it demonstrates the design strategy of manufacturers developing 
conversational AI systems which exploit the human tendency to interpret 
technology in terms of the social world (Reeves and Nass, 1996).  
 
40 
The findings from this question form the basis for the second question, 
which tests and demonstrates the perlocutionary effect of relational things that 
talk through practice, manifesting as four discursive prototypes: 
How can a discursive design strategy activate people to challenge 
the commercial development of conversational AI systems and re-
imagining more desirable future realities being with relational things 
that talk? 
This research question also frames the parallel inquiry which explores the 
potential impact of claiming relational things that talk as a discursive design 
strategy for new forms of cultural expression and social action. It argues for a 
participatory method within a discursive design approach and within the 
commercial design of future technologies, as a mechanism to activate people to 
demand more ethical and desirable future AI systems.  
The research questions of this thesis, outlined above, generate the 
following objectives which deliver against and clarify the overall aims of this 
practice-based research inquiry: 
Objective 1:  
Test and substantiate the hypothesis of the perlocutionary effect of 
relational things that talk through four discursive prototypes developed 
with the people these systems affect. The engagement of young people 
and self-identifying women are specifically prioritised. 
 
Objective 2: 
Evidence the commercial design strategy of conversational systems that 
exploit the human tendency to anthropomorphise things through 
commercial examples. 
 
Objective 3:  
Appropriate conversational AI systems with their target users to unmask 
the complexity of these systems and extrapolate counter-narratives for 
what these technologies, and their consequences, could be in the near 
future. 
 
Objective 4: 
 
41 
Empower people to challenge, discuss and participate in technology 
development (a process in which the technology consumer is largely left 
out) by creating opportunities for hands-on technology development and 
design.  
 
Objective 5: 
Test the impact of a discursive design approach extended with a 
participatory method in generating and concretising ideas around current 
and near future relationships between humans and conversational 
systems, through creating actual and traceable involvement of their future 
users. 
 
Objective 6: 
Claim emergent conversational AI technologies for new forms of creative 
practice, which has social debate as a fundamental goal and desired 
outcome, to disrupt the commercial development of unethical and 
exclusive AI systems. 
 
These objectives inform the development of the overall practice-based 
research inquiry and the contribution to new knowledge. Within this inquiry 
theory and practice is reflective of each other and emerge as an iterative 
process. The theoretical foundation of new knowledge emerging from the first 
question is tested and iterated through the practice. This informs the theoretical 
proposition of the perlocutionary effect and the potential impact of a discursive 
design strategy to challenge the commercial development of conversational AI 
systems. The ambition is to develop practical and theoretical contributions 
which are relevant and have an impact on creative practice across Art and 
Design, and an influence on the commercial development of AI systems. 
 
 
1.5. Chapter outline 
 
This thesis is structured through three core chapters. The first presents 
and grounds the hypothesis of this practice-based research inquiry; the 
perlocutionary effect of relational things that talk; tested through the iterative 
 
42 
practice outlined in chapter three. It begins by outlining the reality-forming role of 
language in chapter two, ‘Speaking of Reality Generating Things’, by drawing a 
parallel with the influence of conversational AI systems. This chapter forms the 
theoretical basis for the perlocutionary effect produced by conversational 
systems upon the feelings, thoughts or intentions of the user, (such as directing, 
persuading, scaring, enlightening, inspiring or dominating). It describes the 
factors of influence that constitute this effect, their relationality and 
persuasiveness, and the valence of this effect on a user, propagated by a 
system’s hybrid intentions and embedded bias, relative to a user’s susceptibility. 
Rooted in commercial examples and evidenced through secondary research, it 
demonstrates contemporary design strategies for conversational systems which 
exploits their relationality and persuasiveness, proposing their perlocutionary 
effect on users. 
Chapter three, ‘Prototyping Relational Things That Talk’, describes the 
practice-based research conducted to test the hypothesis of the perlocutionary 
effect. It describes this practise which manifest as four discursive prototypes; This 
is Where We Are (TIWWA), Emoti-OS, Women Reclaiming AI (WRAI) and The 
Infinite Guide, where each iterates the findings from the previous. It is 
contextualised through examples of forms of cultural expression and social action 
by designers and artists which have captured people’s imaginations around a 
future living with human-like artificial systems.  
The documented findings from the practice tests inform the description of 
the construction and valence of the perlocutionary effect and the causal 
relationship between the factors of influence and the effect on users.  Integral to 
the narrative of chapter three is the description of the method of engaging people 
 
43 
in the design of and interactions with the discourse put forth through the practice. 
In so doing, this chapter proposes the appropriation of relational things that talk 
as a discursive design strategy, extended with a participatory method, for new 
forms of cultural expression and social action which activate people to demand 
more ethical AI systems.  
The thesis concludes with the final chapter ‘Being With Relational Things’, 
which summarise this research inquiry’s practical and theoretical contributions to 
new knowledge which are relevant and have a potential dual impact across art 
and design practices, as well as towards the commercial design of conversational 
systems. These contributions specifically span: ethical design frameworks for 
conversational AI systems; discursive design approaches and methods, and the 
appropriation of conversational systems, relational things that talk, for new forms 
of cultural expression and social action through a participatory arts and design 
practice. It closes with a summary of future research and concluding remarks.  
 
1.6. Ethical guidelines 
 
This practice-based research inquiry conduct within this thesis 
appropriates conversational AI systems which engage people in dialogue as 
mechanisms for new forms of cultural expression and social actions through a 
participatory arts and design practice. In so doing it follows the following policies 
and frameworks: 
 
• ‘ESRC Framework for Research Ethics’ (Economic and Social Research 
Council’s (ESRC), 2015)   
 
44 
• ‘Ethical Guidelines for Educational Research’ (The British Educational 
Research Association’s (BERA), 2018) 
• ‘Research Ethics Policy’ (The University of Plymouth, 2018) 
• ‘Code of Good Research Practice’, (The University of Plymouth, 2018) 
• ‘Research Data Policy’, (The University of Plymouth, 2018) 
 
Ethical approval was secured for the Emoti-OS project which engaged 
young people and teachers from Plymouth School of Creative Arts (PSCA) as 
participants, collecting and storing anonymised conversational data from peoples’ 
conversations with the Emoti-OS chatbot. This also included summarised and 
anonymised information from informal focus groups led by the lead PSCA teacher 
Angus Reith. Information explaining the research and their participation was 
provided verbally and in writing to the participants through formal school 
assemblies, through their lead teachers in person and through myself as the lead 
researcher, as well as through the Emoti-OS website chatbot. Informed consent 
was sought through the PSCA management in loco parentis. (See Appendix II: 
Emoti-OS Information Sheet and Consent Form for Ethical Disclaimer). 
Developed in partnership with PSCA and conducted within the school further, 
safeguarding was provided and adhered through PSCA’s safeguarding policies.  
Ethical approval was also secured for the Infinite Guide project (see 
Appendix III: The Infinite Guide Information and Consent Form (online)) which 
collected 
and 
stored 
anonymised 
conversational 
data 
from 
peoples 
conversations with the Infinite Guide chatbot. This also included summarised and 
anonymised information from informal focus groups led by the Neil Winterburn, 
Learning Technologist FACT. Developed in partnership with FACT Learning and 
 
45 
conducted within their premises the project fell within their safeguarding policies 
for working with young people.  
Whereas the TIWWA and WRAI projects follows the University, ESRC and 
BERA’s research frameworks and principles outlined above, they did not require 
ethical approval. These projects did not store or use people’s personal data to 
inform the research conducted within this thesis, or fall within the other 
requirements for ethical approval of research. 
 
 
1.7. Limitations of research 
 
This practice-based research inquiry of this thesis is focused on 
investigating the implication of conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, 
‘relational things that talk’, on the way people experience the world. In delivering 
against this research agenda the author recognises the following limitations: 
• The research is situated within a context of the development of AI 
technologies 
located 
in 
a 
largely 
culturally 
western 
and 
developed economy with an  advanced tech infrastructure when compared 
to other nations. It does recognise that the influence of conversational AI 
technologies on the individual and society as a whole does assume a 
privileged position of having access to these systems and to their services.  
• Similarly, the potential impact of a practice taking place in the UK and 
which is restricted to the English language,  is potentially limiting in terms 
of its engagement, and may compound a western and privileged 
perspective. 
• This inquiry recognises that conversational AI technologies are in their 
infancy and their effect is currently limited. However, it is not about what 
these technologies are doing to us now, but what they may do to us in the 
 
46 
near future. It is rooted in the documented concerns of the wider 
implications of AI systems on the individual and society as a whole.     
• It also recognises that there is a substantial portfolio of work from a diverse 
set of artist doing social practice, but for the contextualising of the 
prototyping practice outlined here in chapter three, the focus is on work 
that can be said to apply relational things which exploit the human 
tendency to interpret technology in terms of the social world, and that invite 
people into their discourse by appropriating these technologies both as a 
medium and a subject matter

2. Speaking of Reality Generating Things 
 
 
‘Listen more often to things rather than beings’ 
(Diop, 1948) 
Chapter introduction 
 
This chapter develops the hypothesis of the ‘perlocutionary effect’ of 
conversational systems, ‘relational things that talk’; described as the sum of their 
influence on a user’s actions, thoughts, or beliefs. Through evidencing the reality-
forming role of language and ‘technological things’, the inquiry underpins this 
hypothesis. It deconstructs the ‘perlocutionary effect’ by interrogating the factors 
constituting and propagating this effect; their ‘relationality‘ and ‘persuasiveness’, 
(designed through a system’s conversational ability, personality, personalisation, 
affective and embodied functions), and  propagated through a system’s 
embedded bias and ‘hybrid intentions’.  
Evidenced through secondary research, this theoretical inquiry has been 
reinforced by commercial examples. The purpose of this chapter is to highlight 
the specific design functions and strategies applied within the development of 
conversational systems to pinpoint their correlation with the ‘perlocutionary effect’ 
on a user and frame the hypothesis which is tested through the prototyping 
practice outlined in chapter three. In so doing, this chapter responds to the central 
research question of this thesis:  
 
How do conversational AI systems, ‘relational things that talk’, 
influence the subjective reality and related thoughts, behaviours and 
actions of their users? 
 
 
 
 
48 
2.1. The Conversational Interface 
 
Natural language is intrinsic to human existence. It enables us to share 
our experiences, make sense of the present and predict the future. It also 
reaffirms and mediates our subjective experience of reality (Berger 
and Luckmann, 1966). Up until this point man and machine have spoken different 
languages, where the onus has been on humans to translate language through 
a graphical user interface (GUI). Now, due to recent technological advancements 
in processing, machine learning and language technologies, systems are 
becoming capable of understanding more than just syntax (McTear et al., 2016). 
These developments - alongside the rise of smartphones with inbuilt 
microphones and ubiquitous connectivity - render the dream of conversational 
interfaces18 a reality (Brownlee, 2016).  
Conversational systems exploit the human tendency to interpret 
technology in terms of the social world and apply their understanding of social 
relationships to their interactions with artificial systems (Reeves and Nass, 1996). 
This triggers a critical paradigm shift in human-computer interaction and relation. 
The potency, influence and effect of these human-artificial relationships will 
depend on a conversational systems’ ability to engage with, relate to and 
persuade their users. Factors which are directed by a systems’ design and 
functionality, and compounded by the intentions of their manufacturers, 
embedded system bias, and the susceptibility of a user.  
The pursuit of developing ‘talking and feeling’ machines with human-like 
functions are no-longer fictional depictions, but a reality with AI powered 
                                                
18 McTear, Callejas, and Griol (2016) in ‘The Conversational Interface: Talking to Smart Devices’ simply 
define ‘conversational interfaces’ as enabling ‘people to interact with smart devices using spoken language 
in a natural way — just like engaging in a conversation with a person’ (p.1). 
 
49 
conversational systems offering social interactions and simulated affect. These 
systems have their roots in the development of abstract conversational interfaces 
in the 1960s with ‘text-based dialog systems for question answering and chatbots 
that simulated casual conversation’ (McTear et al.,2016, p51). They gave the 
illusion of intelligence, as seen in the ELIZA natural language processing 
computer program initiative developed by Weizenbaum (1966). He (1976, p.6) 
was startled to see how quickly and deeply users got emotionally involved with 
the system and how they ‘unequivocally anthropomorphized it’ and therefor 
became an avid critic of dialog systems that simulated casual conversation. In 
spite of Weizenbaum objections, McTear et al. (2016) stipulate how these 
developments has formed the basis for voice user interfaces, embodied 
conversational agents, social robots and today’s intelligent conversational 
systems.  
Eliza was one of the first programmes that presented itself as what Turkle 
(2007b, p. 62) describes as a ‘relational artefact’. It was powered by a rule-
based dialogue generation which capitalise on simulating sentence through 
matching key words with pre-written responses. However, it was the human 
tendency to anthropomorphise artefacts and relate to them that generated the 
perceived impact of the system. Fast forward to the conversational systems of 
today, where innovations in Machine Learning, natural language processing, 
device proliferation, ubiquitous connectivity, steeped in pools of data, has 
supercharged these earlier rule-based systems and augmented their potential 
functionality and impact. Conversational systems of today can be context aware 
and perform more complex tasks whilst simulating levels of empathy, emotion 
recognition and personality. They enable, according to McTear et al. (2016, p 22), 
 
50 
people to talk to their devices in an intuitive and natural way, and the systems to 
respond in appropriate and human-like ways. 
Conversational systems are being deployed on various technology 
platforms, such as smart watches, social robots, voice activated devices, 
computers and mobile phones. Each platform provides different functionalities, 
from the voice, text and image capacity of mobile phones, to spatial and 
environmental movement and sensor input of social robots. With the increasing 
complexity of these platforms, this also brings additional multimodal input and 
output functionalities, increasing the communitive capacity of the conversational 
system installed. These systems are often powered by a mix of rule-based and 
machine learning algorithms and capable of using human language (through text 
and speech), as an explicit emulation. Some systems use the modality of voice 
commands (as Apple’s ‘Siri’19, Google’s ‘Google Assistant’20, Amazon’s Alexa21 
and Microsoft’s ‘Cortana’22), a mix of voice and text, or just text.  
There are also hybrids23, or human-assisted chatbots where messages 
with a lower confidence level are forwarded to human operators to be reviewed, 
actioned, or used to train the system further. Alongside these systems, there are 
also nascent systems emerging to the market, which are explicit in their 
application of emotional recognition and response, such as ‘Replica’24 and

20 https://assistant.google.com/ 
21 https://alexa.amazon.com 
22 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cortana 
23 Facebook’s ‘M’ was a hybrid chatbot where inquiries which could not be resolved by the AI was forwarded 
to humans. The ambition was to build and train the Ai to automate almost all of M’s tasks. However, as 
Griffith and Simonite (2018) states, as its offered an open domain rather than narrow task range (like 
Amazon’s Alexa), users would therefor ask for increasingly complex tasks to be fulfilled. A large proportion 
of these, they explain, had to be handled by the system’s humans counterparts. It therefore became clear 
that M would always require a sizable workforce of expensive humans, and become less viable. This also 
indicates one of the big challenges with these systems ability to simulate human-like qualities; the 
disproportionate relationship between user expectations and system abilities.

Microsoft’s China-based ‘Xiaoice’25. Many of these systems are also deployed 
with different physical (such as robots) or virtual embodied forms (such as 
avatars). Some systems like the SoftBank’s ‘Pepper’26 incorporate all the 
functionalities above; through a robotic form with mobility, environmental sensors, 
a conversational interface which is trained to use facial recognition to read 
emotions and recognise users.  
With the augmentation of multimodal user input and output, the system’s 
ability to relate and entice the users into a deeper human-machine relationship 
increase. These developments are all springing from the commercial pursuit to 
create human-like assistive systems which can emulate human dialog. The idea 
of natural and fluid conversational exchange with machines has been depicted in 
science fiction since the 1950s. With the omnipresence of conversational and 
intelligent machines introduced by science fiction authors such as Isaac Asimov 
in ‘The Naked Sun’ (1957) and Arthur C Clarke’s ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’ 
(1968), we have since become accustomed to expect this of technologies that 
talk. However, the reality of these systems is still fraught with limitations and 
errors, often the user’s expectations conjured through science fiction, the media 
and simulated human-like systems, does not match the actual system 
functionality. Andrew Ng, chief scientist of Baidu, states (in Kojouharov, 2016);  
‘Here’s one example of something it cannot do: have a meaningful 
conversation. There are demos, and if you cherry-pick the conversation, it 
looks like it’s having a meaningful conversation, but if you actually try it 
yourself, it quickly goes off the rails’.  
 
                                                
25 Xiaoice, has according to Microsoft, an ‘empathic computing framework’ and over 600 million users 
(Spencer, 2018).

In spite of the limitations of current conversational systems, the rise of 
conversational modalities and intelligent systems are affirmed by the investments 
made and products launched by the technology giants such as Apple, Google, 
Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft. The ambition is, according to Google’s Chief 
Exec Pichai (2016) to integrating voice assistants as ‘…an ambient experience 
that extends across devices making it a natural and integrated part in the context 
of a users’ daily life’. This pursuit is further demonstrated with Google’s human-
sounding voice assistant, ‘Duplex’, in May 2018 (Google, 2018). Indistinguishable 
from a human voice, this has been hailed as the ultimate technological 
achievement, supercharged with human-sounding vocal cues, such as ‘ums’ and 
‘ahs’ and powered by natural language processing. Simultaneously, as Lomas 
(2018) highlights, this has raised a backlash of ethical concerns of these systems 
for being designed for deception.  
The launch of Duplex in many ways illustrates where we are in terms of the 
pursuit of systems indistinguishable from humans, fraught with the lack of clear 
ethical guideline, transparency of systems functionality and data usage. 
Conversational systems emerging onto the market are draped in layers of 
simulated humanisation efficiently exploiting the human predispositions to apply 
animacy and sentience to objects (Reeves and Nass 1999; Turkle’s 1984, 1995, 
2004, 2007a, 2007b). They shift, according to Persson et al. (2002, p.21), how 
users view technology from tools to actors, understanding them in terms of 
human behaviour and intentionality. Collectively they indicate a paradigm shift in 
terms of how we interact with intelligent systems and the level of influence these 
have on human experience mediated with and through them. Within this new 
paradigm, conversational systems are positioned as the new user interface, 
 
53 
bringing new levels of immediacy, ubiquity, authenticity and natural interactions  
(Connolly, 2017; The Economist, 2017; McTear et al.,2016). Conversational 
systems brings forth a reality generating potency, rooted in language, augmented 
by technological innovation and realised through exploiting humanity’s tendency 
to anthropomorphise things. 
 
 
2.2. The reality forming role of language 
 
Driving the development of conversational AI systems is the pursuit of 
developing systems capable of conducting fluid natural language interactions 
with people as a more effective way for us to interact with computational systems. 
Language understanding itself has always been one of the primary goals of AI - 
to develop computational models of the knowledge and the processes involved 
in executing linguistic tasks (Gillis, et al., 2009). The performative use of language 
rooted in ‘speech act theory’ (Wittgenstein, 1958; Austin, 1968, Searle, 1969, 
1975, 1979) has been used to design, train and enhance language understanding 
and abilities of conversational agents27. The pursuit is rooted in the role of 
language in human-human interactions, and is therefore important to start with 
exploring the construction and reality forming role of language in itself.  
Language affords the objectification and communication of the experience 
of everyday life. It enables us to affirm, maintain, as well as modify our subjective 
realities. Berger and Luckmann (1966, p.173) state that conversations are the 
                                                
27 See  Bruce (1975), for the first attempt to account for Speech Act theory in terms of AI work on actions 
and plans, and for further work on the wider implementation of this framework within AI and Natural 
Language computational models see; Allen (1994); Allen and Perrault (1980); Appelt (1982 and 1985), 
Cohen and Perrault (1979); Dijkstra and De Smedt (1995); Phillip et al. (1979). 
 
54 
‘actualizing of this realizing efficacy of language’ and thus ‘the fundamental 
reality-maintaining fact is the continuing use of the same language to objectify 
unfolding biographical experience’. Through language we can describe and share 
countless matters, whether it is through a monologue or a dialogue with others. 
It becomes an ‘objective repository of vast accumulations of meaning and 
experience’ (ibid., p.51). Berger and Luckmann (ibid., p.54) describe it as 
enabling the whole world to be ‘appresented’ at any time and at the same time 
capable of transcending the reality of everyday life altogether.  
Berger and Luckmann (1966, p.40) propose that reality is always socially 
defined and that conversation is the most important means of maintaining, 
modifying and reconstructing these subjective realities and knowledge itself:  
The theoretical physicist tells us that his concept of space cannot be conveyed 
linguistically, just as the artist does with regard to the meaning of his creations 
and the mystic with regard to his encounters with the divine. Yet all these - 
dreamer, physicist, artist and mystic - also live in the reality of everyday life. 
Indeed, one of their important problems is to interpret the coexistence of this 
reality with the reality enclaves into which they have ventured.  
 
The concern here lies with what they (1991, p.37) describe as the reality of 
‘everyday life’, rather than the notion of an objective reality, which exists 
independently of the mind. The intention is to explore the role of other individuals 
and ‘things’ in mediating the way in which we interpret, share, construct and 
reconstruct our subjective reality, and is therefore focused on the reality that 
stands out as the ‘paramount reality’ as it ‘imposes itself upon consciousness in 
the most massive, urgent and intense manner’ (ibid. p.37).  
The reality of ‘everyday life’ is part of the multiple realities of an 
intersubjective world that we share with others. We exist and reconstruct our 
subjective reality through interacting and communicating with others. This reality 
becomes socially defined, as a subjective experience of everyday life, rather than 
 
55 
an objective reality of the natural world (ibid.). This reality is therefore taken for 
granted as reality, as we share the experience of it with others. This proposition 
of an interpretive and subjective reality is further underlined by Verbeek (2005, p. 
50): 
“Reality” is not something absolute that human beings can ever know once 
and for all; it is relative in the most literal sense of the word—it exists only 
in relations. Reality in itself is inaccessible for human beings. As soon as 
we perceive or try to understand it, it is not “reality in itself” anymore, but 
“reality for us. 
 
This interpreted reality, which Verbeek (2003, p.93) describes as being ‘situated 
subjectivity’, is mediated and influenced by other individuals and ‘things’. The way 
in which we interpret and share these subjective realities themselves are in a 
continuous flux of reconstruction as we communicate and share our lived 
experience with people and things; an act which is integral to human existence. 
What we interpret as the ‘world’ and what we ‘are’ arises, according to Verbeek 
(ibid), from the interplay between us and reality.  
Language can also make present events, experiences and people of the 
past or imaginary futures. This process of using language to interpret and 
communicate the experience of everyday life within ‘finite provinces of meaning’ 
(ibid., p.40), also immediately distorts the reality of everyday life.  By enabling 
mental constructions to be shared and reconfigured, individuals absorb, adopt or 
even confuse memories of things that have actually happened in their lives with 
those told to them by others, or heard from fictional accounts (Suddendorf, Addis 
and Corballis, 2009). This continuous process of the construction, modification 
and sharing of subjective realities is proposed by Tucker (2014, p.340) as 
necessary to guide and lead individuals to take certain actions and avoid others 
‘even though every vision is an illusion’.  
 
56 
Despite our highly developed ability to direct our future based on our past, 
our interpretive predictions about realities to come are notoriously fallible. 
However, Gilbert & Wilson (2007) propose that to compensate for such 
weaknesses one adaptive function of language may be to improve the accuracy 
of predictions by drawing on narratives from others, and their experiences of what 
the future may hold. These can be ‘explicitly reported, shared, remembered and 
violated’ (Moulton and Kosslyn: 2009, p1278). We do so, so naturally, that we 
rarely question the accuracy, bias or subjective nature of such simulated realities 
and their authors (people, algorithms or artefacts, or a combination of these).  
The subjective nature and imbued intentionality of language is not only 
constructed through syntactic, grammatical and semantic use of words. This is 
conjured through sophisticated application of verbal and non-verbal cues, such 
as intonation as well as non-verbal signals, alongside contextual influences, 
motives, social conditioning, previous experiences and so on, both in the speaker 
and the listener. All of these factors contribute to the transmission of meaning 
and intentions beyond the utterance of sounds which influences our ability or 
declaration to act. In essence, language becomes a performative act where the 
speaker and listener are intertwined in an exchange of meaning and knowledge, 
reconstituting and influencing the way in which we see the world, both in 
intentional and unintentional ways.  
Conversation, between human-humans and human-computers, has the 
potential to influence the participants; requesting, questioning, complimenting, 
promising, informing and directing. It is a performative execution of language 
wherein the words spoken bring forth the potential of action. The notion of a 
speaker performing an action was first proposed by Wittgenstein (1958) and 
 
57 
further developed by Austin (1962) and Searle (1969). Austin described this 
performative use of language - of performative utterances - which brings about 
an action or result. This was central to his theory of ‘speech acts’, where he (1968, 
p.108) divides this performativity of words into three types of acts28, each with a 
performative outcome; a ‘locutionary act’, ‘illocutionary act’ and the 
‘perlocutionary act’.  
Out of these three acts, it is the  final performative act, the ‘perlocutionary 
act’, which is here applied to underpin the overall proposition of the perlocutionary 
effect of conversational systems. Austin described this act as ‘what we bring 
about or achieve by saying something, such as convincing, persuading, deterring, 
and even, say, surprising or misleading’ (ibid., p.108). A perlocutionary act has a 
‘perlocutionary effect’ on a listener, influencing their thoughts, emotions and 
actions (ibid). This act can be seen, according to Searle’s (1969, p. 25), as a 
direct outcome of an illocutionary act (which brings forth the intention of the 
speaker to do something, (Austin 1968, p.108).  These speech acts can therefore 
be said to carry the potential of influencing a listeners thoughts, behaviour and 
actions, which is further affirmed by Searle’s (1969, p. 25) contribution to Austin’s 
general theory of speech acts. A speech act may however bring both intended 
and unintended effects on the listener, and is influenced by a range of social, 
mental and contextual factors. Together these performative speech acts 
contribute to the reality-generating potency of language in conversations.  
                                                
28 The first speech act is described by Austin (1968, p.108) as ‘a locutionary act’, which he 
describes as ‘uttering a certain sentence with a certain sense and reference’. This is the intentional act of 
saying something that carries meaning and is well-formed from a syntactic point. Austin describes performing 
an ‘illocutionary act’, ‘such as informing, ordering, warning, undertaking, &c., i.e. utterances’ (ibid., p.108). 
By saying something, we bring forth an intention to do something. These are utterances that Austin describes 
as having a ‘certain (conventional) force’ (ibid., p.108)., ie. how what was said was meant. The final 
performative act, the ‘perlocutionary act’, is described by Austin as ‘what we bring about or achieve by saying 
something, such as convincing, persuading, deterring, and even, say, surprising or misleading’ (ibid., p.108). 
The perlocutionary act and effect can be seen as the effect of both the locutionary and the illocutionary act. 
 
58 
2.2.1. The reality-generating potency of conversations 
The intention of the speaker in producing a specific utterance is described 
by Searle (1969) as the illocutionary force of an utterance. This force together 
with the ‘propositional content’ (which specifies the details of the action, such as 
what the hearer is being requested to do) composes the act and outcome. 
Illocutionary acts can be distinguished through their illocutionary force29, or the 
speaker’s intentions inherent in the act of performing that utterance. Grice (1967) 
describes this as a process of accessing each other’s mental states where the 
speaker and listener exchange and interpret displays that evidence their mental 
state and understanding. Grice recognises the context of conversation; not just a 
mere chain of isolated sentences but rather as interlinked acts within a wider 
discourse.  
We engage in discourse and take turns in acting as speakers and listeners, 
exchanging propositional content imbued with intentions and perlocutionary 
potential. We communicate and simultaneously participate in an act of re-
affirming and re-constructing each other’s social realities. Geis (1995) critiques 
Austin and Searle’s framing of speech acts as ‘individual, constructed utterances, 
isolated from actual or even explicitly imagined conversational contexts’ (ibid., 
p.xii) and instead argues that they should instead be taken as ‘communicative 
social actions’ (ibid., p.16). He proposes a focus on how we ‘do’ speech acts in 
multi-turn and social conversational interactions, which ‘involve particular factual 
                                                
29 In “A Taxonomy of Illocutionary Acts” Searle (1975) propose to classify five ways of using 
language in this way; ‘assertives’ (statements or conveying information), ‘directives’ (commands 
or requests), commisives (promises or commitments), ‘expressives’ (congratulations, apologies, 
or other expressions of emotions) and ‘declaratives’ (performatives acts that bring about a 
different state of the world such as pronouncing, declaring, confirming, etc.).  
 
59 
states, social relationships between participants, psychological states and 
attitudes, among other nonlinguistic things’ (ibid., p.13). 
Conversations between people not only express propositions and perform 
actions, but also conjure a range of (intended and unintended) effects. These 
performative acts do not happen independent of context and interaction, but are 
a conduit for a confluence of factors. An utterance may mean different things to 
different hearers. Factors such as the social relationship between the speaker 
and the hearer, the status of the speaker or other social conditions between the 
speaker and the hearer may also influence this effect. Berger and Luckmann 
(1966, p. 174) propose that conversations hold a different density of ‘the reality 
they produce or maintain’, and are also assigned different levels of privileged 
status and authority.  Conversation has an inherent reality-generating potency, 
an ability to bring forth and re-configure our perceived past, present and future 
subjective realities, which are influenced by a range of social, mental and 
contextual factors. 
The reality-generating potency of conversations are related to the 
perceived authority of the person (or thing) we are talking to, as well as the 
perceived social context of the conversation and inherent social structures, 
expectations and norms (Berger and Luckmann 1966, Moulton and Kosslyn, 
2009). Burr (2003) proposes that people present themselves and their version of 
events in such a manner that it will predominate other propositions. The 
perception of these acts is directly linked to the perceived power and status of 
the individual. We communicate our intentions through performing speech acts, 
imbued with our bias and world views. By doing so we intentionally and 
unintentionally influence each other’s perceived past, current and future 
 
60 
subjective realities.  Similarly, as we engage in discourse with each other, we are 
also engaging in conversations with systems. These are encoded with their own 
reality-generating potency, perlocutionary potential and perceived authority, 
directed by the intensions of their manufacturers. Through their ability to relate to 
us and persuade us, they invite us to interact; always available, serving and 
listening. 
 
 
2.3. The reality mediating role of technological 
things 
 
 
Conversations are inherently social; fundamentally about how we are 
influenced by one another in day-to-day life. We therefore quickly project these 
social frameworks onto artefacts that are capable of simulating human 
communication models. We assimilate, share and absorb narratives of the world 
around us from others, both through direct conversations, as well as through 
distributed information systems. This process does not have to happen face-to-
face. It may take place across different spatial dimensions, mediated by 
communication devices or in writing (text messaging, live chat etc.). It may also 
take place with things that talk; such as chatbots, voice assistants, robots and 
other artificial agents. These interactions, facilitated through natural language 
processing capabilities, bring new artificial actors to the process of mediating and 
re-constructing our social realities; realities manufactured by corporations; spun 
from data collected from our personal devices; delivered through technological 
artefacts.  
 
61 
Technological artefacts are becoming active participants in maintaining, 
modifying and reconstructing our subjective realties and knowledge itself. 
Verbeek (2003) builds on Ihde’s (1990) notion of a mediated reality, proposing 
that the human-world relationship is mediated and co-constituted by 
technological artefacts. These technologies shape people's perceptions and 
interpretations ‘(the ways in which reality can be present for humans)’ and also 
their actions and engagement with reality ‘(the ways in which humans can be 
present in their world)’ (Verbeek, 2003, p. 93). These ‘things’ do so by 
transforming perceptions and interpretive frameworks, therefore shaping the way 
we encounter reality (ibid). 
Our perception of a subjective reality and the way in which we are involved 
with this reality emerge through the mediation of these artefacts. They ‘coshape’ 
the access we have to reality itself (ibid, p.104) and help to ‘determine how people 
act’ (ibid, p.236). Technological artefacts mediate the way in which reality comes 
to be meaningful for us, and therefore actively contribute to the way we live our 
lives. This active contribution also has according to Verbeek (2005, 2011) an 
important moral dimension. They are not simply neutral instruments but shape 
our daily actions and decisions as active artefacts through ‘amplification and 
reduction’ as Verbeek states (2005, p. 195): 
From an existential perspective, artifacts mediate human existence by 
giving concrete shape to their behavior and the social contexts of their 
existence. This kind of mediation can be described in terms of translations, 
whose structure involves invitation and inhibition; some forms of 
involvement are fostered while others are discouraged. Both kinds of 
mediation, taken together, describe how artifacts help shape how humans 
can be present in the world and how the world be present for them. 
 
The mediating role of technological artefacts in amplifying specific 
perceptions and reducing others, is described by Verbeek (2006a, p. 4) as 
 
62 
‘technological intentionality’. Building on the work by Idhe (1990), Akrich (1992) 
and Bruno Latour (1992), Verbeek (2005, 2006a, 2008b) proposes that this 
Intentionality30 can force people to behave in certain ways, seducing and 
persuading them to take certain actions. He (2006a, p. 3) describes this 
technological mediation as having two dimensions which firstly help to ‘shape 
how reality can be present for human beings, by mediating human perception 
and interpretation’ (the hermeneutic dimension) and secondly ‘help to shape how 
humans are present in reality, by mediating human action and practices’ (the 
pragmatic dimension). These dimensions of mediating technologies impose and 
guide users on how to act when they are used (ibid). 
Verbeek (2008b, p. 388) proposes that because of this ‘intentional 
structure of human experience’ humans can never be ‘understood in isolation 
from the reality in which they live’. Searle (1980, 1990, 1995) proposes that the 
meaning and function people ascribe to a technological artefact is a derived form 
of Intentionality; it has a social character and is rooted in other intrinsic forms of 
intentionality. This is what distinguishes them from ordinary objects, but at the 
same time he rejects the idea that technologies could be Intentional in the same 
manner as humans (ibid.). Building on Ihde’s human–technology relations31 
Verbeek (2008b, p. 390) challenges Searle’s ideas, by introducing the concept of 
‘cyborg intentionality’, ‘intentionality that is partly constituted by technology’. He 
                                                
30 Intentionality is a core concept widely debated across fields of philosophy each with a different definition 
of the concept. Searle (1983, p.1) defined this in ‘Intentionality’ as ‘… that property of many mental states 
and events by which they are directed at or about or of objects and states of affairs in the world’. This thesis 
will adopt Searle's (ibid) way of distinguishing the narrow sense of 'intentional' (meaning that an actor has a 
specific intention to do something) from the broader philosophical notion 'Intentional' as defined above. 
31 Ihde (1990) describes the idea of a technologically mediated Intentionality through outlining four 
relationships human beings can have with technological artefacts: embodied relations (the mediating 
technology becomes an extension of the human body); alterity relations (humans interact with the 
technology); hermeneutic relations (technologies provide representations of reality) and human–technology 
(background) relations (where technologies are not experienced directly) (ibid). Within this inquiry both 
‘(mediated) human beings and (multistable) technological artifacts are constituted’  (Veerbek, 2008b, p. 392).  
 
63 
(ibid) further distinguish two other forms of intentionality related to human-
technology relations; ‘hybrid intentionality’, where the ‘human and the technology 
are merged’ into a new hybrid entity, and ‘composite intentionality’, referring to 
‘situations in which not only human beings have intentionality, but also the 
technological artifacts they are using’. This goes beyond forms of mediated 
Intentionality which occur when human intentionality takes place through 
technological artefacts. This Intentionality becomes distributed between humans 
and systems, and constructs new ways of seeing the world. 
The idea of the a intentionality of artefacts where a relation between 
human beings and the world is mediated by a technology, is relevant when 
discussing the potential influence of conversational systems. These systems sit 
within Verbeek’s idea of composite intentionality. Some systems become 
information points providing information or ‘aboutness’ about existing realities, 
whilst others actually construct or reveal a reality that can only be experienced 
by technologies. The latter does so by doing what Verbeek (2008b, p.393) 
describes as ‘making accessible technological intentionalities to human 
intentionality’. Some advanced systems, through increased agency, deep 
learning neural networks and increased processing power, are able to create 
realities that can only be experienced by humans through the system’s 
descriptions and visualisations. Here Verbeek proposes a ‘double Intentionality’ 
where the technology is actually constructing or revealing a reality ‘that can only 
be experienced by technologies, by making accessible technological 
intentionalities to human intentionality’ (ibid, p.393).  
 
 
 
64 
2.4. The hybrid intentions of things 
 
 
No longer are technological artefacts passive and mute; rather they are 
active and mediating things with which we are in the process of merging in 
significant ways (Haraway 1991; Ihde 1990; Verbeek, 2005, 2006a, 2008b, 2011; 
Latour 1993; Hayles 1999). There is a different form than the philosophical idea 
of intentionality at play within conversational systems. In many ways it connects 
and informs the effect of Verbeek’s ‘hybrid intentionality’ and ‘composite 
Intentionality’ and is also situated within human-technology relations. This is 
rooted in the narrow sense of 'intentional' and the range of intentions encoded 
within conversational systems. This is here called ‘hybrid intentions’ and is 
constructed from the (declared and undeclared) intentions of the manufacturers 
of the systems, their designers and the intentions of their users in using the 
systems. These hybrid intentions may be said to influence a user’s mental image 
or aboutness of things, their intentionality of reality itself, through the ideas 
outlined in Verbeek’s composite intentionality. Here technological systems, 
imbued with the intentions of their manufacturers and designers, influence not 
only what it enables their users to think and do, but also the way in which these 
systems mediate or makes reality available to them.  
Due to the complexity of these systems, current patent rights, 
commercialisation and the value of data mining, many intentions of their 
manufacturers are hidden within the systems themselves, and therefore arguably 
difficult to decipher and predict unless this is clearly stated by their manufacturers. 
These corporate intentions also inform these system’s technology platform, 
functionality and interfaces design, how users’ data is harvested and used, as 
well as ethical (or lack of) frameworks applied. Their designers may also encode 
 
65 
their own intentions within the construction of the systems; to increase user 
satisfaction and engagement, or control user interaction and objectives. At the 
same time, their users will also have their own intentions in using the system as 
well as bringing their own subjective context, intentionality and world view. This 
confluence of intentions contributes to a conversational system’s ability to sway, 
inform and persuade a user to act or think in certain ways. With these systems 
increasing ability to play a profound role in the decisions we make, what we do 
and how we perceive the world, the notion of their hybrid intentions becomes 
important to reveal and understand. 
 
 
2.5. The bias of things 
 
Technological artefacts shape and mould our perceptions of who we are, 
and influence how we relate to our environment and others. Their increasing 
complexity, ubiquity and autonomy means algorithmic decisions affect nearly 
every aspect of our lives. These systems are not neutral, but imbued with 
relational ability, hybrid intentions and persuasiveness. Within these encoded, 
intentional and unintentional effects, there are inherent human and machine 
biases. Bias (unconscious and conscious) dominates our everyday life and is, 
according to Ross (2014, p3), ‘influenced by a pattern of unconscious 
assumptions that we have absorbed throughout our lives’. He underlines that a 
large corpus of empirical research demonstrates that people apply biases and 
stereotypes all of the time, largely without realising they are doing it (ibid). Ross 
(ibid, p.4) describes these as a result of ‘…social conditioning, belief systems that 
we have been taught or exposed to, particular incidents that we remember, or 
 
66 
any number of other assumed “truths” that we have picked up along the way’. By 
developing a capacity to compartmentalise things and people (into categories 
such as gender, race, sexual orientation, age, and so on) Ross (ibid) proposes 
that this allows us to quickly determine what we can expect from our encounters 
with things and people, now and in the future. It helps us to quickly determine and 
predict the safety of a person or situation to help to negotiate an ‘extremely 
complex and busy world’, ensuring the individual’s success of survival (ibid, p.5).  
In contemporary society we are increasingly reliant on computational 
systems to conduct decision making on our behalf. They convert data into 
decisions with unprecedented speed informing an array of decisions from access 
to healthcare, mortgages to employment. However, the data used to train these 
systems reflects biases from the conditions within which it has been collected, 
the world views of those coding the systems and also from people using these 
systems (if these system are being trained on user data), and may give some 
groups preference over others based on gender, race, sexuality, postcode and 
so on (Anderson and Anderson, 2007; Ball, 2018; Madhu, 2018; Knight, 2017a, 
2017b; O’Neil, 2017). O’Neil (2017, p.17) underlines this in her book ‘Weapons 
of Math Destruction’: 
Like gods, these mathematical models were opaque, their workings 
invisible to all but the highest priests in their domain: mathematicians and 
computer scientists. Their verdicts, even when wrong or harmful, were 
beyond dispute or appeal. And they tended to punish the poor and the 
oppressed in our society, while making the rich richer. 
 
While these algorithmic systems outperform people in processing speed 
and accuracy, they also have the potential to inherit a representation of human 
 
67 
bias. These systems are not optimised for identifying bias32 or fairness, but to do 
a task. They are only as good as their mathematical construction and the data 
they are trained on (Vanian, 2018) and can be ingrained with stereotypical 
concepts of gender, race and sexuality which then perpetuates this bias in the 
resulting application (Leavy, 2018). The choice of training data within these 
systems and an understanding of how it has been collected are therefore vital. 
This can render a system responses from being appropriate to providing 
inappropriate sexist and racist slurs; as seen with Microsoft chatbot Tay in 2016 
(Hunt, 2016), an experimental AI chatbot that unleashed racist tirade after 
learning through interaction with its Twitter followers, or as biased against 
individuals based on their ethnicity; as seen with COMPAS the AI risk 
assessment software used by law enforcement in the US to assess the risk of 
reoffending (Oswald et al., 2018), or biased based on gender; as seen with 
Amazon’s recruiting tool that was shown to unfairly discriminate against female 
applicants (Cook, 2108). 
These systems rely on input data as well as algorithmic frameworks to 
process inputs and generate outputs. Increasingly these systems are constructed 
through applications of AI such as Machine Learning, which analyse data 
according to pre-set parameters through forms of supervised learning. These 
                                                
32 It is here recognised that bias in machine learning is a required function in predictive algorithms used 
required specification to determine a desired behaviour in prediction making (Dietterich & Kong 1995). 
However the use of the term here implies the definition put forward by Madhu (2018) in his report ‘Are 
Machines Doomed To Inherit Human Biases?’ for the Forbes Technology Council’ as; ‘the systematic 
differences between samples and a population as it pertains to model precision (predictive value, false 
positives) and recall (sensitivity, false negatives).’ The use of the term here is closely related to the influence 
of human bias within computational systems (through data and computational models)  reinforcing 
stereotyping and other forms of mis-representation. This human-caused bias are constructed through 
different factors. Ford, G. (2018) outlines four types of biases; ‘Sample’ (‘…occurs when the data used to 
train your model does not accurately represent the environment that the model will operate in), ‘Prejudice’ 
(a result of training data that is influenced by cultural or other stereotypes), ‘Measurement’ (… happens when 
there’s an issue with the device used to observe or measure), ‘Algorithm’ (the mathematical property of an 
algorithm’ where the ‘counterpart to bias in this context is variance). The latter refers to the Dietterich and 
Kong’s (1995) definition above. 
 
68 
parameters are defined by the intentions of the manufactures, framed by their 
engineers in accordance with the goals of the system. Innovation with Deep 
Learning systems are also emerging, which generate outputs from any functional 
form of data within the computational models through unsupervised learning. Due 
to these systems complexity, Gilpin, et al. (2018) state that these systems often 
cannot provide insights into their behaviour and thought processes. They (ibid., 
p 1) underline that the ability of these ‘black-box’ systems to offer transparency 
and provide explanations of their decisions in some level of detail is vital to ensure 
‘algorithmic fairness, identify potential bias/problems in the training data, and to 
ensure that the algorithms perform as expected’ 
Herein lies the weakness of these models. They are only as good as their 
training data based on traces of millions of human conversations, inherently 
subjective and biased, and often riddled with stereotyping and other types 
misrepresentation. The bias within systems are also hidden within their 
infrastructure and goes undeclared to users, who’s opinions, thoughts and 
behaviours it may sway. The recent 2018 report by The AI Now Institute 
(Whittaker, et al., 2018, p. 3) underlines that the lack of frameworks presently 
governing AI, its pervasiveness, complexity, scale, basic safeguards of 
responsibility and liability, means this is an increasingly urgent concern. 
Worryingly, it (ibid, p.7) also underlines that the gap between those who develop 
and profit from AI and those most likely to suffer the consequences of its negative 
effects is increasing not reducing: 
There are several reasons for this, including a lack of government 
regulation, a highly concentrated AI sector, insufficient governance 
structures within technology companies, power asymmetries between 
companies and the people they serve, and a stark cultural divide between 
the engineering cohort responsible for technical research, and the vastly 
diverse populations where AI systems are deployed. These gaps are 
 
69 
producing growing concern about bias, discrimination, due process, 
liability, and overall responsibility for harm. 
 
Vanian (2018) proposes that the real issue isn’t technical but 
philosophical, as it is impossible to naturalise all ingrained cultural bias, not only 
in society, but within both historical and current data being generated by an 
inherently biased population. It is also challenging to take into consideration (and 
attempt to codify) aspects such as fairness, given that it means different things to 
different people (ibid). This is compounded by the increased complexity of these 
systems; the lack of ‘explainability’ of how such deep learning neural networks 
arrive at their decisions (Madhu, 2018); the hidden bias within data sets (and the 
way the data has been collected) used to train them, and the black boxing of 
proprietary systems where the corporations guard their computational models, 
data and algorithms (Vanian, 2018).  
These concerns are becoming recognised across public and private 
sectors, with the UK Government commissioning several recent white papers on 
the influence of and ethics related to AI (‘Algorithms in decision making’ (House 
of Commons (2018)) and initiating the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation33 
(an advisory body set up to investigate and advise on data-enabled technologies, 
including AI). The European Commission has acknowledged these challenges 
through setting up the ‘High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence’ in June 
2018, which is tasked with developing guidelines for trustworthy artificial 
intelligence (first presented in December 2018 (European Commission, 2018)). 
Similarly, many industry partnerships and initiatives are emerging, such as the 
‘Partnership for AI’34 (an initiative including Amazon, Facebook, Google,

34 https://www.partnershiponai.org 
 
70 
Microsoft, IBM, and Apple) which are responding to the call for best practices, 
transparency and ethics within AI development. However, these initiatives are 
playing catch-up with the current stage and deployment of AI across society. 
AI algorithms could be capable of making less biased decisions than a 
typical person. However, as underlines by Stone, P. et al. (2016) in their report 
on the future of AI and life, this remains a deep technical challenge, and requires 
the data that inform AI-based decisions to be kept free from biases that could 
lead to discrimination. Simultaneously, the challenge of bias may be compounded 
through the recognised ‘severe lack of diversity in the AI field’ (World Wide Web 
Foundation, 2017, p.15) which may lead to limited world views and stereotyping 
being encoded into these systems, as well bias not being identified when it 
occurs. Leavy (2018, p.14) further highlights that the over-representation of 
(white) men in the design of these technologies could ‘quietly undo decades of 
advances in gender equality’. She (ibid) suggests that those who are potentially 
affected by bias are more likely to see, understand and attempt to resolve it and 
therefore diversity within the development teams within in ML is crucial to prevent 
algorithms from perpetuating existing discrimination. She further propose 
specifically relating to gender that by AI development should embrace decades 
of research on how gender ideology is embedded in language to implement better 
data sets and system design.  
The awakening to a deeper understanding of the potential impact of these 
systems is taking place, but as the World Wide Web Foundation (ibid, p.35) 
underline needs participation of those people it will affect; 
As questions around ethics continue to be posed and addressed, it is 
essential that this discussion is opened up to different interest groups from 
within and outside of the AI community. Any attempt to make AI more 
ethical and responsive will have to be done through an inclusive process 
 
71 
that incorporates the views, ideas and realities of a diverse group of 
countries and individuals.  
 
AI technologies that power conversational systems, and a range of other products 
and services, are already pervasive and ubiquitously integrated in society through 
algorithmic predictions and decision making within closed systems of influence. 
People have already voluntarily (involuntarily) entered into relationships with 
artificial systems through their; phones, smart devices, social media services, 
home entertainment, their mortgage and credit application and health 
diagnostics. The influence they have will not only depend on the system 
functionalities, hybrid internationalities and inherent bias, but on how we relate to 
these systems, or how these systems trigger us to relate to them. 
The challenges facing society with the ubiquitous integration of AI services 
are also recognised by the House of Lords Select Committee on Artificial 
Intelligence (2018) in the UK in their recent report ‘AI in the UK: ready, willing and 
able?’. This report highlights the need for ‘balanced and representative’ data-
sets, diverse development teams which are drawn from ‘diverse gender, ethnic 
and socio-economic backgrounds’ and more ‘representative of wider society’, 
and which are ‘aware of, and adhere to, ethical codes of conduct’. There are an 
increasing awareness of these issues, but the public and private sectors are 
playing catch up with the already advanced of pervasive influence of AI systems. 
By introducing new intricate relationships, beyond fundamental use and 
availability, these technologies are already changing the way we perceive the 
world and sway our thoughts and actions from a potentially biased worldview.  
 
 
 
72 
2.6. The relationality and persuasiveness of 
technological things 
 
Relational things not only engage us in deeper relationships as ‘evocative 
objects’, but also, according to Turkle (2007b, p 62), ‘clarify our relationships to 
the world and ourselves’.  She (ibid,. p.71) states that the relational ability of these 
artefacts is not based on their ‘intelligence, consciousness, or reciprocal pleasure 
in relating’ but rather in ‘their ability to push our Darwinian buttons, by making eye 
contact, for example, which causes people to respond as if they were in a 
relationship’. These artefacts signal that they are entities appropriate for relational 
purposes by triggering our human tendency to project human characteristics on 
non-human things (Reeves and Nass, 1999). People feel a desire to attribute 
them with personality, intelligence, and emotion, to nurture them, and for this to 
be reciprocated (Fogg and Nass, 1997a; Fogg and Nass, 1997b; Nass, Moon, et 
al. 1997; Kiesler and Sproull 1997; Reeves and Nass 1999; Turkle, 1995, 2004, 
2007b; Weizenbaum 1976). These systems are becoming increasingly better; not 
only at making the users feel understood on a semantic level, but also on an 
emotional level. They display behaviours that make users perceive and feel like 
they are understood, that the systems care and have a level of sentience or a 
nascent mind (ibid). These artefacts ‘don’t just do things for us, they do things to 
us, including our ways of thinking about ourselves and other people. (Turkle, 
1995, p. 26).  
Conjured by the increasing humanisation and levels of intelligence of 
relational artefacts, we grapple with the notion of what is authentic in an age of 
simulated relationships with relational artefacts (ibid). Since the 1990’s we have 
seen a new generation of technologies designed to be sociable and engage 
 
73 
people in affective relationships (Kiesler & Sproull, 1997; Moon, Youngme, and 
Clifford Nass, 1996; Parise, Kiesler, Sproull, & Waters, 1999; Reeves & Nass, 
1996; Turkle 2007b). However, this is less about what the systems are capable 
of simulating and more about what these simulations do to us. It questions our 
human susceptibility to a design strategy that exploits our vulnerabilities, offering 
artificial companions that are evocative but not relationally authentic (Turkle, 
2007b). These relational artefacts are still without true understanding or empathy; 
as Turkle proclaims, ‘Simulated thinking is thinking, but simulated feeling is not 
feeling, and simulated love is never love’ (2007b p. 72, [1984]). We are confronted 
with artificial entities that take the role as social actors; they behave in human-
like ways leading our brains to unconsciously default into treating them as human 
(Moon, et al., 1996).  
People form social and reciprocal relationships with technologies, a 
relationship in which these technologies can, accordingly to Fogg et al. (2008, p 
139), take on the role of ‘persuasive social actors’. Fogg (1999, p134) describes 
persuasion as ‘a non-coercive attempt to change attitudes or behaviours’ and 
within this context necessitates an attempt to influence a person. He applies this 
to interactive technologies designed with the intent to change people’s attitudes 
or behaviour, and describes these as ‘persuasive technology’ (1998). This 
proposition has led to a wide collection of empirical research being conducted 
supporting not only the idea that computers do in fact appear to be superior 
persuaders compared to humans, but also that people tend to form a social and 
reciprocal relationship with technology35. Fogg (1999) further proposes that this 
                                                
35 In the context of persuasive technologies for further research supporting the claim that people tend to 
form a social and reciprocal relationship with technology which influence their actions and behaviours see; 
Fogg, 1998; 1999, 2003; Fogg, & Nass, 197a, 1997b; Fogg et al., 2008; Moon & Nass, 1996; Nass, et al. 
1997; Nass, et al. 1999; Reeves & Nass, 1996. 
 
74 
implies that an intentionality is at play in terms of the act of influencing a person’s 
attitudes and/or behaviours.  
The success of contemporary interactive technologies and applications 
hinge on tapping into and influencing people’s attitudes or behaviours (Fogg et 
al., 2008). From persuading users to upgrade software services to purchasing 
products through technology platforms; to continue playing games and sharing 
on social networks to creating experiences that build product loyalty; persuasion 
is integral for successful user experience design. The level of influence varies 
from almost imperceptible, such as creating a feeling of trust and helpfulness, to 
greater influences in terms of motivating somebody to quit smoking or eat 
healthier. Fogg et al. (2008, p.136) describe this as taking place on a ‘micro’ and 
macro’ level. At the micro level, these technologies may not have a persuasive 
outcome as the overall goal, but incorporate levels of influence, such as with a 
software’s spelling and grammar checker. On a macro level, the intention is for 
an ‘overall persuasive outcome’, such as persuading users to purchase a product 
on Amazon or eBay (ibid). The core objective of these (and other technology / 
service platforms) is to persuade and motivate users.  
We are surrounded by technologies and systems with the ability to 
persuade us in different ways and with different outcomes. Fogg et al. (2008, p. 
136) describes this a ‘macrosuasion’ and ‘microsuasion’ and that it is 
implemented in code to influence what we think, and more and more, what we 
do. These technologies of persuasion are, according to Fogg (ibid.) everywhere:   
Persuasive technology is in our living rooms, in our cars. When we 
communicate with our loved ones online, through Facebook, persuasion 
is there. When we withdraw money from the bank at the ATM, an element 
of persuasion may be there. When we purchase a gift online for a birthday, 
once again, we are being exposed to persuasion. In fact, we carry a 
persuasive platform, the mobile phone, with us most everywhere we go. 
 
75 
 
The design process of these persuasive technologies builds on extensive 
knowledge of human psychology and nature; of what motivates us, our strengths 
and weaknesses, our fears and desires. However, as Fogg (1999) underlines; 
persuasion is not a technological thing, but an everyday part of human life, which 
we are accustomed to dealing with in most aspects of our existence. The 
difference is that computers are persistent and increasingly ubiquitous in a way 
that people rarely are.  
Latour (1992, 1994, 2002) proposes that the ability to influence is not 
specifically about a certain type of technology, but rather that all technologies 
influence and even co-shape what we do. He (1992, pp. 259-260) describes the 
influence of artefacts on humans as ‘scripts’ that prescribe to their user how to 
act when they use them. The designer of these artefacts works with an inscribed 
user in mind, to whom he prescribes properties, behaviour, like a program of 
actions that an artefact affords (ibid). The ability of these artefacts to influence is 
according to Verbeek (2006b, p.371) of a specific nature; they mediate action as 
material things in a ‘…complex interplay between technologies and their users’. 
Technologies may be designed with a specific intended influence and use, 
however they may be used in unforeseen ways and therefore have a level of 
unpredictability in terms of their influence on human actions (or used in the 
intended manner but trigger unforeseen influence) (ibid).  
This notion, that all interactive technologies have a level of influence and 
persuasion, is central to the exploration conducted here. It follows Fogg’s 
(1998,1999) framing of persuasive technologies as a product of human-computer 
interaction (as opposed to computer-mediated communication) and where the 
persuasive intent is built into the product as its core objective. All forms of 
 
76 
persuasive technology fundamentally exist to persuade. Fogg’s notion that the 
potential persuasive effects must be intentional and planned is extended to also 
include by-products of the interaction, or effects that are rooted in these 
technologies’ mediating capacity; their hybrid intentions and relationality. The 
persuasiveness of conversational technologies36 is here used to extend Fogg’s 
(1998, 1999) term ‘persuasive technologies’ taking into account that 
persuasiveness is integral design tool for successful user experience design.  It 
makes a distinction as to whether a system has been explicitly designed and is 
explicitly intended to be persuasive (persuasive technologies), or where the 
intention was not to have a persuasive outcome as the overall goal, but 
incorporate levels of influence within the overall design process (persuasiveness 
of conversational systems) to achieve its objectives. 
The persuasiveness of conversational technologies is intertwined with 
their relationality and considers expected and unexpected persuasive effects and 
influences emerging from the complexity and unpredictability of Machine 
Learning (ML) algorithms (with the ability to learn and produce automatic credit 
scores or conduct loan assessments or inform admissions decisions) proliferating 
in everyday life. With the innovations in ML, data processing and sophisticated 
technology platforms, conversational systems are becoming persuasive social 
actors, with an ability to influence users’ attitudes and behaviours without being 
explicitly presented as such.  
                                                
36 To support the notion that that all interactive technologies has a level of influence and persuasion the 
term the ‘persuasiveness of conversational technologies’  (persuasiveness) will be here used to amplify the 
term rooted in Fogg’s (1998, 1999) use of ‘persuasive technologies’. This term is limited to interactive 
technologies where persuasion is intentional and planned and not by-products of the interaction. The 
persuasiveness of conversational technologies take into account the commercial design frameworks of 
these systems which applies the tool of persuasion (and relationality) extensively to achieve its objectives. 
 
77 
Conversational systems and their potential influence are evolving through 
the increased humanisation of technologies, adopting an array of devices, 
delivery platforms and interfaces. A pursuit driven by their manufacturers 
optimising the relationality and persuasiveness of these systems for fluid 
integration into people’s lives. These factors of influence  are constructed through 
the design of their systems functions; conversational ability (NLP understanding, 
conversational depth, reason and reference, ability to hold multi-turn 
conversation, domain coverage and contextual understanding), personality 
(traits, embodied and conversational characteristics, demographics etc.), 
personalisation (adaptation to a user’s profile), affective (ability to recognise and 
simulate emotion) and embodied functions (visible manifestation (physical or 
virtual) and embodied expressions). The effect of this design strategy is amplified 
through the choice of technology platforms and compounded by a user’s 
susceptibility. It is essential in understanding the effect of conversational systems 
on their users. The design of these systems functions is outlined below with case 
studies to unpack and demonstrate the design strategies applied with the 
development of conversational system.  
 
2.6.1. Conversational ability 
The ability of conversational systems to engage users in dialogue is not 
only rooted in its ability to process and respond appropriately to user requests, 
but increasingly in their ability to simulate nuanced aspects of human-human 
dialogue; infused with empathy, humour, and wide domain knowledge. Though 
contemporary conversational systems exist on a continuum of social complexity, 
 
78 
they all have in common a requirement of language processing, alongside a level 
of understanding of human behaviour and social context.  
The purpose of a conversational system informs its functionalities and 
related user interaction. Some systems are capable of conducting long 
conversational threads and ‘remember’ multiple turns and user response, 
simulating levels of emotive understanding and empathy, whilst others are built 
only to respond to short transactional exchanges. Nimavat and Champaneria 
(2017) distinguished conversational systems through their knowledge domain; 
designed either as closed-domain, such as Domino’s Facebook chatbot for 
ordering pizza (see figure 11), or as open-domain, such as Amazon’s Alexa37 the

personal voice assistant or Mitsuku38 the social chatbot (see figure 10). Their 
overall system objective - one being to help a customer order a pizza and the 
other to engage users in social conversation - shape the choice of technology 
platform, system design and the level of relational ability required. These system 
objectives are themselves rooted in the intentions of the manufacturers and 
influenced by the developers encoding the systems with their worldviews and 
choice of conversational data. 
The dialogue processing methods, generating conversational responses 
to user queries, largely fall within a rule-based, retrieval-based or a generative-
based system, or a mix of these methods (Yao, 2018). A rule-based system is 
restricted to predefined lists of responses manually constructed and retrieved 
through forms of heuristics. These systems have been around since the 1960s 
with systems such as Weizenbaum’s (1966) Eliza. The majority of conversational 
AI systems that power chatbots, digital assistants, and customer support 
experiences today are, according to Yao (2018), retrieval-based. These systems 
use large conversational repositories to search for a reply that best matches a 
user query. Mitsusku (figure 10) the open-domain conversational chatbot is a 
retrieval-based system, which has, according to Yao (2018), over 300,000 hand-
coded response patterns powering its ability to simulate human-human 
conversation through this wide topic and response repository. The process for 
selecting a response within the Mitsuku system is constructed from pattern-based 
heuristics which is programmed manually. Though labour intensive, this approach 
gives the developer of the system full control of the response outputs, and 
therefore in principle, if their data-set was constructed appropriately and by a

80 
diverse and representative team, should avoid any bias or discriminatory 
interactions.  
Increasingly, Machine Learning and Deep Learning models are being 
applied to train a classification algorithm for this pattern-matching process (as 
applied within personal voice assistants such as Google Assistant39, Amazon 
Alexa40 and Apple’s Siri41, and also applied within the Emoti-OS and WRAI 
projects outlined in chapter three. User dialogue from services such as Twitter 
and Reddit  enable the application of large data-sets of conversational 
interactions, but run the risk of compounding existing human bias within these 
data-sets. Systems that use some combination of rule-based, retrieval-based, 
and generative method, dictated by their context, are becoming the norm (Yan, 
2018). These are systems trained on large amounts of conversational data, 
through supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial learning 
models, in order to learn how to generate new dialogue that resembles it (Nimavat 
and Champaneria,  2017; Yao, 2018). Through this mix of response-driven and 
generative algorithms these systems start to generate more diverse outputs for 
open-domain systems, and signal a new evolution for conversational systems.   
A generative-based model doesn’t use a predefined repository, but 
generates new responses on a large amount of training data through the 
application of Deep Learning models such as Recurrent Neural Nets (RNN) (Yao, 
2018). A method which was applied within The Infinite Guide project prototype, 
outlined in chapter three, section 3.6, where the data-set used for training the

81 
RNN was intentionally biased and limited to a transhumanist42 world-view. An 
intentional and designed disposition reflected in the limited conversational 
vocabulary and dialogue created by the system, created as a commentary on both 
the embedder bias and the limitations of conversational AI systems. As illustrated 
by this project, these systems are currently imperfect and prone to commit 
grammatical and semantic errors (Song et al., 2016). Though they are far off 
being able to generate fluid conversational responses with humans, the pursuit 
to develop generative AI models does frame the overall commercial agenda 
around recreating self-adaptive and learning human-like systems. As evidenced 
above in this chapter, the more human-like conversational systems become, 
generating their own responses and nurturing social interactions, the more they 
are able to trigger our human-human communication frameworks.  
Systems specifically designed for social interactions are particularly potent 
in triggering this human tendency to project social human-human relational 
models onto artefacts. Van Camp (2017) describes his relations with the social 
robot Jibo43 in his article in Wired: 
In time, we began to think of Jibo like a little person. Our expectations 
began to change. We didn’t ask him for help with tasks as often. We just 
wanted him to liven up our day by saying something unexpected or 
chatting with us. This is when things began to get dark [… ] Like I would a 
dog, I felt guilty when I left Jibo alone in the dark all day. I wondered what 
he was thinking when I’d hear him rotate in the distance, and watch him 
look around the kitchen, peering at this and that. Were we treating him 
poorly? Did he secretly despise us? No, that’s silly to think. He’s not alive, 
right? 
 
 
                                                
42The use of the term transhumanist is here described as a ‘life philosophy’ and an ‘intellectual and cultural 
movement’, which seeks to improve the human body and human condition by means of science and 
technology (More and Vita-More’s, 2013, p.4). 
43 https://www.jibo.com/ (Jibo was officially discounted in December 2018) 
 
82 
Whilst creating artefacts that are specialised in triggering these responses, 
manufactures balance the pursuit of designing increasingly human-like systems 
with the potential of falling into the uncanny valley44 with systems so close to 
being life-like, but not, that it generates a feeling of eeriness or revulsion. By 
balancing these requirements and creating personalities with which the users 
have an affinity and feel familiar, manufacturers increase and exploit users’ 
emotional connections with their system, and thus with their commercial 
intentions.  
 
2.6.2. Personality 
The personality45 design of a conversational system is an effective tool in 
triggering users to relate to a conversational AI system. The design of a system’s 
personality is rooted in its objectives (and technology platform) and customised 
based on their target users (Mairesse and Walker, 2010; McTear et al., 2016). It 
is often modelled on human personality traits46 to create a consistent and 
believable representation (ibid). Mairesse and Walker (2010) found that by 
optimising the personality conveyed to match a related personality trait found in 
successful professionals (such as in a sales agent or a tutor) the success of the 
                                                
44 Mori (1970) visualised peoples’ emotional reaction to robots that looked and acted almost human on a 
graph, where he plotted this reaction against the robot’s level of anthropomorphism, creating a negative 
valley, where a robot’s appearance and movement becomes disconcertingly close to human’s. This is 
curve is what he termed the Uncanny Valley and generates a negative response in the user. This takes 
place when something appears to human-like but is not human, and therefore eliciting a feeling of eeriness 
and revulsion in observers 
   
45 The use of  term ‘personality’ here follows the description proposed by McTear et al. (2016), as ‘…the 
characteristics of a person that uniquely inﬂuence their cognitions, motivations, and behaviors in different 
situations.’ 
46 The ‘big ﬁve’ traits model proposed by McCrae and John (1992) is according to McTear et al. (2016, p. 
315) most frequently applied to model a personality proﬁle for conversational systems. This model propose 
the following traits; openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. However 
McTear et al. (ibid) state that largely only two of the ﬁve traits are used for rendering the system’s behaviour 
due to the complexity of modelling these. Therefor a model of bi-dimensional deployment of 
‘introversion/extraversion’ and ‘neuroticism/stability is applied’ 
 
83 
system in reaching its goal increased. This enables systems to react consistently 
to similar situations over time, and project coherent characteristics of cognition, 
motivation, behaviours, and emotion (McTear et al., 2016).  
Transactional and domain specific systems, such as TechCrunch 
Messenger chatbot47 (see figure 13) providing suggestions for articles, tend to 
have less of a personality integrated into its functionality. These systems largely 
focus on representing the brand identity and fulfilling the core transactional 
function of providing information. Systems designed for open domain 
interactions, such as Apple’s personal voice assistant Siri48, also fulfil 
transactional request, but tend to apply levels of personality in the narrative 
structure of the dialogue responses to engage the user, communicate a 
consistent personality to fulfil user expectations. Siri’s personality was originally 
designed as friendly and humble, but also with an edge (Fowler, 2011), mimicking 
a professional person in a assistive role.  
Systems designed specifically for social interactions, rather than 
transactional, such as the humanoid social robot Lynx49 (see figure 12) and the 
social chatbot Mitsuku50, tend to have a more extensive personality characteristic 
designed within its overall embodied representation and dialogue model.  Within 
these systems personality is designed implicitly in the use of language (tone, 
content, phrases, etc.) and explicitly in their embodied (physical and virtual) 
persona. The level of the personality design is related to the system goal and 
type of user interactions facilitated. The design of personality functions within

conversational systems is extensively used across industry to encourage deeper 
interactions with users. The strategies to generate and simulate systems’ 
personalities vary. McTear et al. (2016) propose that by building consistent 
system personalities that are believable, it increases the engagement of users 
and therefore increases the success of the system in achieving its objectives. To 
achieve convincing, intuitive and believable system behaviours, conversational 
systems must, according to Schonbrodt and Asendorpf (2011), support and 
trigger users’ models of human-human communication. By presenting a 
consistent personality, a conversational system gains a user’s confidence and 
trust, and the relationality and persuasiveness of the system increase (McTear et 
al., 2016).  
The impact of design strategy harnessing personality is demonstrated 
through the findings of the Emoti-OS prototype, outlined in the chapter below. 
These findings support that the application of a personality within a 
Figure 13: Lynx humanoid social robot by Ubtech (2018) 
 
Figure 12: The TechCrunch chatbot 
(TechCrunch 2019) 
 
85 
conversational system appears to trigger people’s tendency to relate to the 
system. Even with abstract personality traits, such as demonstrated within the 
TIWWA prototype, people interacting with systems appear to anthropomorphise 
it. This is supported by Nass and Lee (2000) whom evidence that people tend to 
assign personality to synthetic characters they interact with, whether as a direct 
manifestation of a projected system personality, such as Mitsuku (figure 10), or 
more intrinsic personality imbued in the use and tone of language, such as 
Apple’s Siri.  
There is a strong incentive for corporations to tailor the personality of their 
conversational system to their target customers and the task at hand, to increase 
the efficiency of their system in achieving its overall goal, but also to root it in the 
personality of their brand. People have, according to McTear et al. (2016, p. 317), 
an affinity with personalities that are similar to their own, a phenomenon known 
as the ‘similarity-attraction principle’. The process of adapting an agent’s 
personality to match that of a user is therefore a common approach within the 
design of personality in conversational interfaces.  Nass and Lee (2000) state 
that if the personality of a system matches a user’s own personality, this 
encourages a user to perceive the conversational systems as more credible, 
positive and competent. With systems being able to dynamically generate a user-
adaptive, personality-rich model, which performs, speaks and behaves in a way 
that establishes affinity with the user, this again increase their potential influence 
on a user. Simultaneously, corporations can deepen their users’ engagement 
with their brand and their embedded (declared and undeclared) intentions with 
their system-user interactions.  
 
 
86 
2.6.3. Personalisation 
Most conversational systems also require some level of personalisation 
whether it is just remembering a user’s name in a conversational thread, or more 
complex personalised interactions based on a detailed data profile of user and 
their needs and preferences. Rather than providing a generalised set of 
responses that it is trained to deliver, the latter systems build up an 
‘understanding’ of their users through repeat interactions, access to and 
datamining of their personal accounts, aiming to provide relevant and 
personalised interactions. Personal voice assistants, such as Siri, Google 
Assistant and Alexa, not only need to respond to users’ open-domain requests, 
but also offer a range of personalised services, proactively anticipate user needs 
- reminding them of an upcoming event or offering recommendations without 
receiving explicit requests to do so.  
A social chatbot is also increasingly expected to be able to offer further 
personalised interactions based on a user’s background, personal interests and 
unique needs. According to Shum et al. (2018, p. 16), These systems have to 
‘generate responses that are emotionally appropriate, encouraging and 
motivating, and fit the interests of the user’ as well as ‘guide conversation topics 
and manage an amicable relationship in which the user feels he or she is well 
understood and is inspired to continue to converse with the bot’. Moreover, they 
(ibid) state that the system needs to continuously improve and learn from its user 
interactions through active and adaptive learning.  
The application of responsive and dynamic systems which can personalise 
their interactions to a user requires an understanding of the user, (through the 
harvesting, processing and storing of user data), and the ability to trigger 
 
87 
appropriate system behaviours. Mairesse and Walker (2010) propose a model 
where the personality of the user is assessed, (through methods like 
questionnaires or automated personality detection) then informs the ‘personality 
adaptation model’ of the system to match that of the user. This adaptation informs 
not only the behaviour of the system, but the linguistic and acoustic content of 
the interactions; use of language, construction of sentences, pitch, volume, 
speech rate, expressives and pauses. For example, as outlined by Nass and Lee 
(2000), if the overriding personality of the system is ‘extrovert’, this should adjust 
the personality model to speak rapidly, loudly and with a higher pitch, as related 
to this personality trait. 
The responses generated by a conversational system can also be 
triggered based on the user context, offering increased complexity and variation 
in the system’s conversational ability. In addition to these functionalities, there is 
also a requirement to be able to narrate a sequence of events and keep the 
continuity of a conversation. Nimavat and Champaneria (2017, p. 7) propose that 
these abilities will become increasingly important;  
For virtual assistants that aim to be friends or companions of the user, the bot 
should be able to converse when the user continues conversations that the 
user left midway. For example, if the user had been talking about an item and 
then says "Do you remember that mug I was talking about that had a blue 
handle?" the bot should be able to recall all other associated properties of the 
mug the user had mentioned…As bots get more personal, we would also want 
them to recall stories that another family member told them and narrate them 
back to us. 
 
Personal assistants in particular need not only to be reactive; they also need to 
proactively anticipate user needs. Shum and Li (2018) stipulate that actions 
reminding the user of upcoming events and personalised recommendations of 
products and services (based on their personal and contextual user data) are 
 
88 
imperative, and should happen without the system receiving explicit requests 
from the user to do so. By so doing systems capable of optimising these 
functionalities, simultaneously augment their relationality and persuasiveness, 
making their users more susceptible to their influence. 
The social companion chatbot Replika.ai51 (see figure 14) is one of the 
most advanced versions of a social chatbot system in terms of its ability to 
personalise its interactions to its user. It is described as; ‘your personal artificial 
intelligence friend who is always there for you’ (Replika, 2019). Positioned as a 
personal confidant that helps users ‘to express and witness’ themselves by 
offering a ‘helpful conversation’ (ibid), the system learns from its user interactions. 
Through this process it personalises its interactions through learning to mimic its 
user. The overall objective of Replika is not to resolve user tasks or provide 
information, but to nurture a friendship with its users, triggering human social 
interaction frameworks; such as trust, empathy and care. By so doing it is refining 
its ability to impersonate a user’s individual preferences, mannerisms, and 
patterns of speech, unleashing a range of ethical concerns in regards to the 
application of these system functionalities beyond its playful ‘chat’ interface.

Through the development of conversational AI systems designed for social 
interactions which demonstrate sufficient social skills and awareness of their 
different users, personalise and generate responses that are emotionally 
appropriate, encouraging and motivating, they deepen their potential relationship 
with their users, and at the same time increase their potential precautionary 
effect. The design methods, systems and functionalities of these conversational 
systems are pursued in the name of making interactions with computational 
systems fluid, natural and familiar. These approaches, powered by innovations 
in NLP, ML and DL, contribute to the arsenal of design tools being tested and

refined to push our social buttons and entangle users in emotive relations with 
systems incapable of true feeling. In so doing, increase the potential influence of 
their manufactures on a user’s thought, behaviour and actions. 
 
2.6.4. Affective functions 
To form social relationships with users, conversational systems not only 
need to respond with the correct linguistic responses, project personality, and 
offer personalisation; they also need to have a deeper understanding of the 
emotive state of their users. They must, according to Picard (2000), adapt to their 
users and learn from and respond to their affective states which, according to 
Nimavat and Champaneria (2017), makes the user feel more affiliated to the 
system on a personal level. Picard (2000) further proposes that these systems 
also need to be able to compute and predict how their responses may influence 
users’ feelings and then be able to adjust, in real-time, continued outputs and 
behaviours. This ability to recognise, adapt to, and render emotion is, according 
to McTear et al. (2016, p. 324), central to triggering users to perceive the systems 
as credible.  
Affect52 
itself 
is 
central 
in 
human-human 
communication 
and 
demonstrates understanding, care and social awareness. Up until this point, 
Picard (2000, p.15) states, computers have been ‘affect-blind, affect-deaf, and 
generally speaking, affect-impaired’. McTear et al. (2016) and Picard (2000) both 
provide extensive evidence of the importance of affective functionalities in in the 
development of conversational systems. They (ibid) argue that emotion 
                                                
52 The use of the terms ‘emotional’ and ‘affective’, here follows Picard’s (2000, p. 24) use as adjectives 
interchangeably used to describe ‘…either physical or cognitive components of emotion, although 
"affective" will sometimes be used in a broader sense than "emotional”’.  
 
91 
recognition and display increase usability, efﬁciency, trust, rapport, and improves 
user communication. Picard (2000) states that the challenge is how to regulate 
and associate emotions of the systems with their behaviour. This, she (ibid) says, 
becomes a question of ‘will’ which is currently not directly implemented within 
affective systems. Rather, it emerges from the mechanisms that consider 
‘…goals, values, and situations, and decides whether or not the emotion which 
arises is suppressed, expressed, or acted upon in a particular way (ibid, p126). 
Affect within conversational systems are grounded in the ability to recognise and 
simulate appropriate response. It is an important function in the manipulations of 
a user’s emotive response to interactions with a conversational AI system.     
Current computational models of emotion are limited in terms of their 
ability to represent a wide range of emotions. The models applied are partly, 
according to McTear et al. (2016, p. 310), based on theoretical models from 
psychology, neuroscience, sociology, and linguistics, but largely focus on the 
single dimension of valence (whether or not the emotion is positive or negative). 
A system’s ability to read user emotions depends on the system’s goal and the 
technology platform upon which it is deployed. Some systems are limited to a 
basic functionality which can recognise words and infer a valance according to a 
pre-set framework. Others may use sentiment analysis, (a process that analyses 
a corpus of text/voice input from a user to identify emotional tones), as applied 
within the TIWWA (analysing Twitter data), Emotio-OS and The Infinite Guide 
(analysing conversational data) prototypes discussed in the chapter below.  
These methods are still limited in their ability to indicate a wider 
interpretation of a user’s emotional state, and as illustrated through these 
projects, more about giving the user the illusion of an understanding of their 
 
92 
emotional state. More complex systems with multiple affective functions read 
embodied signals, (such as facial gestures, body postures), as well as the tone 
and pitch of a user’s interaction, can start to form a more nuanced picture of a 
user’s emotive responses. These developments have the potential to reveal more 
intimate aspects of a user’s emotional life. They signal a move towards 
personalised, affective and responsive system where the user’s sensitive and 
emotive data can be exploited to fulfil a system’s objectives and at the same time 
its (or the manufacturers’) hybrid intentions. 
We are only recently starting to see research and development of systems 
capable of processing text, voice and embodied emotional responses to generate 
basic emotive behavioural models. Microsoft’s social chatbot XiaoIce53 (see 
figure 15), which since its release in China in May 2014 has attracted over 660 
million users (Zhou, et al. 2018), use a similar dynamic sentiment tracking 
                                                
53 XiaoIce has also been launched in five other countries (China, Japan, USA, India and Indonesia) under 
different names and is accessible on more than 40 platforms, including WeChat, QQ, Weibo and Meipai in 
China, Facebook Messenger in USA and India, and LINE in Japan and Indonesia (Zhou, et al. 2018, p. 1). 
Figure 15: Visual identity of XiaoIce Microsoft’s social chatbot (Spencer, 2018) 
 
93 
method. Through a framework described as an ‘empathetic computing 
framework’ (Cai, 2006; Fung et all. 2016; Zhou, et al. 2018), a user’s emotions 
and moods are detected in real time to adapt the system’s responses (see figure 
16 for a conversation session between XiaoIce and a user with the systems real-
time tracking of emotions, from Shum et all. (2018, p. 22)).  
The primary goal of XiaoIce is to be an AI companion with which users 
form long-term emotional connections. (Zhou, et al. 2018). Designed with a 
persona of a 18-year-old girl who is alwafigure 16ys, according to Zhou, et al. 
(2018, p. 3), ‘reliable, sympathetic, affectionate, and has a wonderful sense of 
humor’, XiaoIce is capable of engaging users in longer-term emotive 
relationships. They (ibid) demonstrate, through the analysis of large-scale online 
conversational logs, that XiaoIce has achieved an average Conversation-turns 
Per Session (CPS) of 23, which they state is significantly higher than that of other 
Figure 16: A conversational session between XiaoIce and a user, from Shum et all. (2018, p. 22) 
 
94 
chatbots and even human conversations54. Shum et al. (2018, p. 14) add that 
feedback from users’ evidence that XiaoIce have resulted in a more ‘positive 
outlook, a feeling of emotional support, and a sense of social belonging’.  
The simulation of emotion recognition and empathy (alongside personality, 
open domain knowledge and other personalisation functionalities) builds trust 
and an emotional connection between human users and the system. By triggering 
a user’s belief that the system recognises their feelings and understand their 
intentions, the affective functions of a conversational system is a powerful conduit 
for increasing its relationality. This was observed through the interactions with the 
Emoti-OS project, (outlined in chapter three, section 3.5), where the 
conversational data indicates that users really felt that the ‘it’ (the system) 
understood them. Some systems use sentiment analysis or user triggered mood 
choices, such as applied in the TIWWA, Emoti-OS and the Infinite Guide 
prototypes, to detect and interpret emotional tones in conversational data and 
then generated responses to simulate affect. XiaoIce also uses sentiment 
analysis of text, but also has highly sophisticated dialogue repository designed to 
convince a user of its ability to emphasise.  
Other advanced systems combine sentiment analysis with computer vision 
to process non-verbal cues (such as facial expressions, gesture, body language 
and tone of voice data) to infer human states. Affectiva55 (2018) is one of the first 
businesses to market selling such ‘artificial emotional intelligence’ services. They 
(ibid) offer multimodal emotion face tracking), in real-time, measuring seven 
emotions: anger, contempt, disgust, fear, joy, sadness and surprise, as well as 
                                                
54 According to Zhou, et al. (2018, p. 3)  on average an AI personal assistant has a CPS between 1.5 and 
2.5 which means that ‘the chatbot speaks once, and the human speaks once’. 
55 https://www.affectiva.com 
 
95 
metrics about an individual’s physical appearance; age, ethnicity, gender. They 
(ibid) also recently added speech analysis, ‘not what is said, but how it is said’, 
by ‘observing changes in speech paralinguistics, tone, loudness, tempo, and 
voice quality to distinguish speech events, emotions, and gender’. Trained on a 
data repository through supervised learning56 models of close to six million faces, 
from eighty-seven countries, they (ibid) state their emotion tracking has an 
accuracy ‘in the high 90th percentile’. 
The race for emotion detection systems capable of mapping the 
emotionally nuanced profiles of people en masse is evident. Not only the pursuit 
of Affectiva, but also evident through the technology giants Amazon, Microsoft 
and IBM advertising their ‘emotion analysis’ services (Schwartz, 2019). The 
ability of conversational systems to infer emotional states as accurately as a 
human, by observing emotional cues and generating appropriate outputs, is a 
vital strategy in the manufacturing of systems capable of nurturing deeper 
relationships with users. However, Picard (ibid) suggests that though we are likely 
to construct computational mechanisms that function like human feelings, these 
will not be the same as our subjective feelings. The frontier, she says (ibid), of 
these systems, lies in enabling personal systems which shift with users’ affective 
states and predicts how it can influence their feelings. It can enable systems, she 
(ibid, p. 50) states, with;  
‘…flexible and rational decision-making, the ability to address multiple 
concerns in an intelligent and efficient way, the ability to determine 
salience and valence, more human-like attention and perception, and 
numerous other interactions with cognitive and regulatory processes’.  
 
                                                
56 Supervised learning is an application of ML where an algorithm is trained to recognize things it has seen 
before. Within emotion detection the algorithm is shown a large quantity of variations of images of faces 
categorised as a certain emotion, and therefore learns to recognise these emotions. 
 
 
96 
With manufacturers of conversational interfaces pursuing systems 
capable of a) inferring emotional states from user observations and b) simulating 
empathy and affect, the ethical and moral challenges of the application of these 
systems deepens. Beyond being applied to simulate affect, these emotion 
detections are also being applied within games, market research, user 
experience and driver monitoring. As Schwartz (2019) highlights, there is growing 
concern around how emotion detection (and related facial recognition 
technologies) could compound bias and stereotyping, misrepresenting 
individuals and groups through codified assumptions about how an emotion is 
expressed within different ethnic cultures. There are also concerns about the 
potential of these systems to be abused for coercion, surveillance and other forms 
authoritative control. It is vital to not only make these potential influences know to 
their users, but also activating users to demand a say in how these systems may 
affect their lives.   
 
2.6.5. Embodied functions 
When people engage in conversations they convey much more than just 
the meaning of the words spoken. They also express intentions, beliefs, and 
emotions and other aspects of their personality and mental state, projected 
through embodied signals such as facial expression, gestures and body posture. 
McTear et al. (2016) propose that such embodied expressions, in additional to 
linguistic and audible characteristics (pitch, volume, speech rate, pauses and 
pitch-range), are vital in stimulating a positive user engagement with the system. 
They (ibid, p. 318) describe these embodied expression as ‘the display of 
gestures and facial expressions, body attitude (posture), gesture amplitude, 
 
97 
speed, direction, and rate, timing of movements, energy (display of) and 
persistence.’  
The embodiment of a conversational interface may be virtual, like an 
avatar, or physical, like a robot. Many embodied systems are capable of reading 
a user’s embodied signals (through biosensors, movement, camera sensors), 
and infer their activity, emotional state and interaction, but also simulate an 
appropriate multi-modal and embodied response to their interaction with a user. 
The Pepper57 (see figure 17) social humanoid robot by Softbank Robotics built to 
serve as a human companion, is such a system.  It can recognise its owners, 
process a user’s verbal and embodied communication, and respond accordingly 
with appropriate dialogue and corresponding gestures and social movements.  
De Graaf et al. (2015) found that humans engage in stronger, more lasting 
relationships when the systems have a form of embodiment.

The overall form and design of an embodied system contributes to its 
overall anthropomorphic qualities and the potential relationship it can develop 
with its users. This was observed through people’s interactions with and 
conversations about the robotic artefacts of the TIWWA prototype, outlined in the 
chapter below.  Audiences interacting with these were calling the robotic artefacts 
the ‘mummy’ and the ‘babies’, and displaying care, affection and concern for their 
emotional states. Kaplan (2001) points to research evidencing that juvenile 
characteristics within artefacts trigger innate responses in humans, making users 
feel immediate and unconscious tenderness towards the system. These 
principles are widely used in character design across film, games and cartoon to 
generate affinity and empathy for their characters, and now it is being applied to 
the design of artificial systems. The ‘trick’, Kaplan (ibid) says, is to entice a user 
to invest time and nurture the artefact through creating a positive feedback loop.  
In a similar way to how an owner cares for a pet, investing time, resources and 
love into the care of the animal, a user can be enticed to do the same with an 
embodied system. This relationship, he (ibid) states, emerges from this self-
reinforcing dynamic.  
Increasingly embodied conversational AI systems are being marketed as 
social companions to be part of a family, such as the Buddy58 (see figure 18), and 
other robots designed and marketed specifically for interactions with children, 
such as Cognitoys59 by Elemental Path and Miko60 by Emotix. Customised with 
the ability to converse, entertain and emphasise, with distinct personalities and 
anthropomorphic features, they evoke, as evidenced by Turkle, users’ desires to

60 https://www.miko.ai/ 
 
99 
nurture them and to be nurtured by them. A process which increases the fluid 
integration of these systems into the social world of a user.  
By displaying believable nonverbal behaviours, these systems improve 
conversational flow (Cassell et al., 2000), engagement and likability (McTear et 
al., 2016). The behaviour and interactions of embodied systems are vital in 
establishing their relational ability. A system does not need to physically look like 
a living animal or human to trigger anthropomorphic attributes, but it needs to act 
like one. For embodied systems to be capable of establishing meaningful 
relationships with humans, these must interact with people in natural ways 
employing social dynamics. Leite et al. (2013, p. 250) map embodied agents 
across dimensions of friendliness; stimulation of companionship, help, intimacy, 
reliable alliance, self-validation, and emotional security. They (ibid) argue that the 
ability to behave in an empathic manner; ‘the capacity to recognise another’s 
aﬀect and respond appropriately’ is a key success factor in establishing and 
maintaining user relationships. It is evident that a design strategy that embeds 
the ability to simulate and display empathy will lead to a system being perceived 
as more caring, likeable, and trustworthy, increasing its influence and relational 
potential. 
Compared to conversational interfaces situated in mobile phones for 
example, embodied systems also have the advantage that they operate in a 
situated environment. Through their specialised and purpose-built technology 
platforms they can gather sensor and contextual data on their environment and 
users. They can therefore connect the use of language with the physicality of 
objects and actors. However, the expectations of embodied systems are greater 
in terms of their multimodal conversational abilities, compared to systems that 
 
100 
only operate with text or voice. They have an increased relational potential for 
being perceived as social actors by their users, but, as demonstrated in this 
chapter, this is dependent on their ability to simulate personality, empathy and 
intelligence. These systems have to balance a fine line between the uncanny 
valley and conjuring human-like qualities.  
Systems such as Sophia61 (see figure 19), the social humanoid robot 
developed by Hanson Robotics, fuels the hype and fantasy around these 
systems. Balancing on the border of the uncanny valley, ‘she’ is developed to 
hold eye contact, recognise faces and express feelings, though it is actually 
human sculpting and animatronics techniques that create Sophia’s impact. 
Sophia is a rudimentary system compared to systems such as Pepper and 
Buddy, deploying a basic chatbot engine, but she conjures the magic of triggering 
human imagination of artificial life. Sharkey (2017) writes in Forbes Magazine that 
‘she’ has become a bone of contention amongst the AI community. Presented as 
sentient and described as ’almost alive’ by her creators, they are criticised for 
making false claims of the system’s capabilities, actively deceiving people (public 
and policymakers alike) and proliferating the misrepresentation of the current 
state of AI. The concern raised by Sharkey is that this act of deception may affect 
vital decisions about the application of these technologies and the ethics and 
guidelines set to impact significantly on our lives. 
In November 2018, Hanson Robotics launched ‘Little Sophia’ (see figure 
20) ‘a smart, interactive robot’ aimed at children, promoted as an ‘opportunity to 
have a Little Sophia join their families — for a purpose … beyond companionship’ 
(Hanson Robotics, 2018). She has a variety of features; she can simulate

emotions, engage in natural conversation, and is able to move around. It is sold 
both as a companion and a STEM tool, specially targeting girls, to learn to code 
through its ‘companion app’. Though it is not promoted as a sentient system, it is 
embodied with andromorphic qualities and functionalities. Children are 
particularly susceptible to such design features as evidenced by Turkle et al., 
(2006b). They found that children perceive robotic pets and dolls as;  “sort of 
alive” because of the quality of their emotional attachments to the relational 
artefacts and because of their fantasies about the idea that the relational artifacts 
might be emotionally attached to them’ (ibid., p. 65). These ‘evocative artifacts’ 
(ibid) trigger people to want to nurture and to be nurtured in return. 
Created as a ‘delicate looking woman with doe-brown eyes and long 
fluttery eyelashes’ (Stone, 2017), Sophia also manifests question about sexism 
and misogyny in the design of humanoid robots, and the wider development of 
AI conversational systems. An issue which is the central driver for the Women 
Reclaiming AI project, described as part of the practice in the chapter below. 
Systems that are designed as female, are commonly also designed as obedient, 
Figure 19: ‘Sophia,’ the female humanoid 
((Hanson Robotics, 2019) 
Figure 20: 'Little Sophia', the humanoid robot aimed 
at children (Hanson Robotics, 2019) 
 
102 
flirtatious and ‘pretty’, perpetuating existing stereotypes and sexism (Fessler, 
2017).  
Compounding these concerns and the potential societal consequence of 
such depictions, is the manufacture of realistic humanoid sex-robots, such as the 
Realbotix’s Harmony62 (see figure 21), a ‘super-realistic simulated woman’ with a 
self-lubricating vagina which can be detached and ‘washed in the dishwasher’ 
(Realbotix, 2019). Harmony responds to sexual advances with welcoming ‘noises 
and expressions’ depending on its ‘owners’ choice of personality and preference 
settings (ibid). To extend the reach and market, Realbotix has also released a 
visual avatar version ‘RealDollX63’ (see figure 22) where a user can customize

Gee (2017), writing in her Telegraph article on the dangers of female sex 
robots, predicts that life-like robotic sex-dolls are likely to become widespread 
within the coming decades, and a poignant manifestation of the way women are 
portrayed in society. Whitby (in Gee, 2017), a philosopher concerned with the 
social impact of emerging technologies and the trivialisation of robots in the 
media, highlights the concerns that people will abuse robots assigned human 
traits; ‘Will people mistreat robots? Oh yes, I’m sure. The reason I’m sure is 
because they already do. The way people first meet artificial intelligence is in a 
character in a video game that they’re shooting at.’ There are serious ethical and 
societal ramifications of the depiction of women in social AI and robotics’ 
objectification of women as entirely objects for male gratification (as depicted in 
pornography). Even the less controversial depictions of women as submissive 
and subservient across conversational systems in general is compounding 
stereotypes. With conversational systems increasingly becoming designed to 
have an intimate relationship with their user, whether as social or sexual 
companions, their potential perlocutionary effect increase, and the potential 
valance of this effect on their users may become largely negative. 
 
Whilst the AI industry criticised Hanson Robotics for the deception of 
intelligence within Sophia, the whole industry is built on perfecting the simulation 
of human-like functionalities and features. This is all about triggering people’s 
susceptibility to a design strategy optimising a system’s anthropomorphic 
functionalities. Even though these artefacts are, as Turkle describes (2007b), 
‘without true understanding or empathy’. It is not about whether these systems 
really have emotion or intelligence, but about what they evoke in us. It is about 
 
104 
our emotional connection to those artefacts and the fantasies we have about 
them.   
The design of conversational systems goes beyond aesthetics and 
functionality, inherent in their design, as Sharkey and Sharkey (2006) state, the 
art of illusion; an act, which brings together the human predisposition to project 
animacy and sentience to objects, with the cultural myths of AI and robotics. This 
is what triggers the public’s active participation in the suspension of disbelief. The 
effect of this design strategy is amplified through the choice of technology 
platforms and compounded by a user’s susceptibility; essential in understanding 
the effect of conversational systems on their users.   
 
 
2.7. The perlocutionary effect of relational 
things that talk 
The human-computer design frameworks applied in the design of conversational 
systems, as explored above in this chapter, exploit their relationality and 
persuasiveness, triggering people’s tendency to anthropomorphise artefacts and 
perceive these as social actors (Fogg et al., 2008; Nass, Moon, et al. 1997; 
Kiesler and Sproull 1997; Reeves and Nass 1999; Turkle, 1995, 2007b; 
Weizenbaum 1976). By displaying behaviours that make users feel as though 
they are dealing with sentient creatures that care about them they are evoking 
deeper relationships (Turkle, 2007b). By interacting socially with these relational 
things, users are susceptible to the intentions of the corporations manufacturing 
these systems, the world views encoded by their designers and the data sets 
used to train these systems. By simulating human-like interactions, 
 
105 
conversational systems indicate a fundamental shift in the way we relate to 
machines.  
When people engage in conversation with each other, taking turns as 
speakers and listeners, they exchange propositional content imbued with 
intentions and perlocutionary potential. People engaging in dialogue with 
conversational systems similarly exchange propositional content imbued with 
intentions. Where human-human conversations are both collaborative and reality 
forming - as actions which change the state of the world - so too is human-
computer dialogue. However, when participating in speech acts with an artificial 
system, one is no longer accessing each other’s mental states, but a different 
simulated mind, incapable (for now) of independent thoughts, desires and beliefs.  
Conversational systems do communicate within existing constitutive rules, 
but their encoded world view, contextual influences, systemic motives, 
conditioning and training data are complex and hidden with algorithmic structure. 
Still, these systems trigger our frameworks for social communication, 
presupposing that both speaker and hearer have certain intrinsic wants and 
desires, interests and intentions, as well as a certain level of emotive capacity. 
However, these systems can only simulate human-like attributes to effectively 
build trust and nurture relationships with their users. Their intentions are rooted 
in commercial exploitation, not in true desire or love. 
The perlocutionary effect produced by relational things that talk upon the 
feelings, thoughts or intentions of the user is constituted by these systems’ 
relationality and persuasiveness, propagated by the system’s embedded bias 
and hybrid intentions, relative to a user’s susceptibility. The perlocutionary effect 
is closely linked to the perceived power, authority and relationality designed by 
 
106 
their manufactures (and designers) and projected by their users onto these 
technological artefacts. It can be measured in a conversational system’s overall 
ability to mediate, generate and reconfigure a user’s perception of their social 
reality.  
With the growing concern about the lack of ethical frameworks within the 
design of commercial AI systems, compounded by embedded bias, limited 
transparency and an almost complete absence of (diverse) user engagement 
within their design process, there is an urgency to unmask the complexity and 
influence of these reality-forming technologies. This call to action is what grounds 
the practice-based research inquiry of this thesis and informs the hypothesis of 
the perlocutionary effect of relational things that talk.  
 
Chapter Summary 
 
This chapter has developed the theoretical foundation for the hypothesis 
of the ‘perlocutionary effect’ of conversational systems, ‘relational things that talk’. 
It has documented the ‘factors of influence’ which constitute and propagate this 
effect; their ‘relationality‘ and ‘persuasiveness’, embedded bias and ‘hybrid 
intentions’. It has described the ‘factors of influence’ which constitute and 
propagate the perlocutionary effect, evidenced the intentional design of these 
factors through commercial examples, and proposed the related effect on a 
user’s social reality. These examples document a design strategy which optimise 
the relationality and persuasiveness of conversational systems through the 
design of their functionalities; personality, personalisation, conversational ability, 
affective functions and embodied functions. This starts to describe an alternative 
approach to the design of conversational systems, in which the starting point is 
the potential effects these systems may have on their users, and whether or not 
this is desirable for those these systems will affect. In so doing, this chapter has 
laid the foundations for the practice-based research inquiry outlined below which 
tests and iterates the hypothesis of the perlocutionary effect.

3. Prototyping Relational Things That Talk 
 
 
‘Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from Magic.’

Chapter introduction  
 
This chapter tests and synthesises the hypothesis of the ‘perlocutionary 
effect’ of conversational systems which has been presented in chapter two. It 
does so through describing the practice-based part of this research inquiry 
conducted through appropriating ‘relational things that talk’. These are created 
through a prototyping practice designed through implementing the ‘factors of 
influence’ constituting this effect.  In so doing, it interrogates the impact of a 
discursive design strategy, extended with a participatory method, actively 
engaging people in a counter-narrative as a form of activism to challenge the 
authority, power and lack of (real) inclusion of users in the commercial design of 
these systems. 
This chapter starts off by framing the prototyping practice, referencing 
relevant works which create a discourse around our relationships with ‘relational 
things’. These take many forms, from art installation to design speculations, but 
in common they all appropriate emergent technologies of their time to make 
people think. The practice is presented as a catalogue of work featured in a 
chronological order to illustrate its iterative nature. ‘This Is Where We Are’ 
(TIWWA), explores the persuasiveness and relationality of relational things 
powered through AI behavioural algorithms and directed by pools of user data. 
‘Emoti-OS’, iterates the findings from TIWWA and analyses the construction of 
relationality through simulated affect, personality and collective (artificial) 
emotional intelligence. ‘Women Reclaiming AI’ (WRAI), demonstrates 
stereotyping and bias in commercial conversational AI developments. The last 
 
108 
prototype, ‘The Infinite Guide’, synthesises and tests the findings from the three 
previous prototypes to substantiate the overall perlocutionary effect of 
conversational AI system.  
The chapter concludes with a summary that synthesises this prototyping 
practice’s findings, documents the ‘perlocutionary effect’ and describes the 
impact of extending a discursive design approach with a participatory method to 
deepen engagement with the proposed discourse. In so doing, this chapter 
responds to the central research question of this thesis:  
 
How can a discursive design strategy activate people to challenge 
the commercial development of conversational AI systems and re-
imagine more desirable future realities with relational things that 
talk? 
 
 
3.1. Creating discourse with and through 
relational things 
 
From art works to discursive design speculations, to hybrids and boundary 
crossing forms, artist and designers have a long-standing practice of critiquing 
the social impact of emergent technologies. Whereas commercial design is 
driven by its utilitarian and profit generating objectives, these practitioners have 
challenged the status quo, and through different mechanisms engaged the 
general public in their discourse. Commenting on our relationship with 
technologies which exploit the human tendency to interpret technology in terms 
of the social world they take many forms. Some apply models of human-human 
communication through conversational interfaces (text or voice), others through 
forms of gesture-based or more abstracted movement-based interactions. In 
common they trigger anthropomorphic qualities (and in some cases zoomorphic) 
 
109 
which exploit the human tendency to interpret technology in terms of the social 
world.  They invite people into their discourse by appropriating these technologies 
both as a medium and a subject matter. Collectively they start to outline, describe, 
cross reference, inform and underpin the practice of this research inquiry; 
appropriating relational things that talk as a discursive design strategy to 
influence the design of future conversational AI systems.  
 
At the root of the exploration of human-machine relations lies the notion of 
communication with artificial systems. The notion of communication with and the 
future influence of systems with automatic and self-regulating control was laid out 
in 
the 
founding 
thinker 
of cybernetics64 
Norbert Wiener’s 
(1965, 
p. 
16) foundational text of 1948 ‘Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the 
Animal and the Machine‘. Two years later, in 1950, he (1989) published  ‘The 
Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society’ where he stated that 
society itself could only be understood through a study of the messages and the 
communication facilities which belong to it; ‘messages between man and 
machines, between machines and man, and between machine and machine’. 
This informed the development of the scientific discipline of cybernetics which 
emerged, according to Shanken (2003, p.19), out of attempts to ‘regulate the flow 
of information in feedback loops in order to predict, control, and automate the 
behavior of mechanical and biological systems’. Wiener expressed a concern 
about the consequences of leaving moral judgement to technologies of control 
                                                
64 Cybernetics was first proposed by Wiener (1965, p. 11) in 1948 in his seminal ‘Cybernetics: Or Control 
and Communication in the Animal and the Machine’ as a scientific ‘field of control theory’ which studied the  
control and communication in the animal and the machine. The basis for Wiener’s proposition is rooted, 
according Shanken, (2003), in the various theories and emergent hypotheses discussed at the 
interdisciplinary Macy Conferences, between 1942 and 1954. These emerge as an understanding of 
‘information theory, computer models of binary information processing, and neurophysiology in order to 
synthesize a totalizing theory of “control and communication in the animal and the machine” (Shanken, 2003, 
p 19). 
 
110 
and the potential commercial exploitation of these technologies. Parallel to his 
thinking (and to his dismay) cybernetics became sensationalised in the 1950s 
and 1960s as the science of robots featured as a topic across the arts and 
science fiction literature (Kline, 2015).  
In 1968 Jasia Reichardt curated the ‘Cybernetic Serendipity’ exhibition (at 
the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London which is credited with popularizing 
the idea of joining cybernetics with art65 (Shanken, 2003). Pask66 (1968), author, 
inventor, educationalist and cybernetician, presented his installation Colloquy of 
Mobiles (see figure 23) as part of this exhibition. Concerned with the role of 
technology in everyday life he conceived human-machine interaction as a form 
                                                
65 In 1956 Schöffer created the responsive robotic sculpture ‘CYSP O’ and ‘CYSP I’. Though he did not 
describe this as cybernetic art, it has later been called the first work of art to explicitly incorporate the 
principles of cybernetics (Gonsales, 2012). 
66 The seminal work by Pask (1975a, 1975b, 1976) on Conversational Theory, rooted in a cybernetics 
framework, and the major influence this work has had on approaches to learning design and the 
understanding of the development of knowledge architectures his here recognised. However, the interest 
here lies in the manifestation of his theoretical work within his art practice. It is Pask as a maker of artefacts 
constructed to have interactions, often with human beings or other artefacts, which provides a critical context 
for the practice proposed within this thesis.  
Figure 23: ‘Colloquy of Mobiles’ [Installation] by Gordon Pask (1968)

of conversation. A process in which the participants learned about each other, 
within controlled systems interactions, through sound, speech, body movements, 
and facial expressions. By inviting audiences in to be part of the ‘conversational 
machines’ he offered an experiential discourse around living with machines 
(Colloquy of Mobiles, 2019). 
During this period artists such as Roy Ascott, Nicolas Schöfferan and Nam 
June Paik, were experimenting with the appropriation of emergent technologies 
to create alternative forms of humanistic expression, which actively engaged 
audiences in new ways. A process in which the participants would be a vital part 
of the artwork and where their behaviour would affect the artwork, functioning as 
a systems of cause and effect. In so doing they were capturing people’s 
imagination and engaging them in their discourse around a future living with 
human-like autonomous systems. This agenda is central to the practice-based 
inquiry described later on in this chapter. 
Ascott claimed this scientific discipline of cybernetics by proposing art itself 
as a cybernetic system, consisting of feedback loops that included the artist, the 
audience, and the environment (Shanken, 2003). Writing in his 1967 manifesto 
‘Behaviourables and Futuribles’ he further describes this dynamic field of 
interacting processes and behaviour; ‘When art is a form of behaviour, software 
predominates over hardware in the creative sphere. Process replaces product in 
importance, just as system supersedes structure’ (Ascott, 2003, p. 157).  
The critical reference to the work of Ascott and the idea of art as feedback 
loops is central to the design methodology applied within this thesis. Here there 
is a dynamic relationship between the artist(s), the audience (as participants), the 
environment (online and offline) and the systems directing and facilitating these 
 
112 
relationships. This allows for a dynamic and evolving relationship between the 
participant, audience and system (or artefact) through feedback loops of 
interaction, data generation and conversation. This practice experiments with 
emergent system behaviour and participation, to engage people in a conversation 
about human-machine relationships. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Whereas Ascott applies a process of behavioural systems to engage 
people, the work of artist Nam June Paik merged the spheres of technology and 
human life in claiming emergent technologies for artistic innovation. Wolf (2018) 
notes in his review of Paik’s work that he often revealed a desire to familiarise 
emergent technologies of his time (such as television and robots) to make sense 
Figure 24: ‘Robot K-456’ [Installation] by Nam June 
Paik (1964) 
 
113 
of these within the known framework of the natural world. Paik was 
philosophically concerned with how to humanise technology and therefore many 
of his sculptures are figurative or physically engage the human form (ibid). His 
work ‘Robot K-456’ (see figure 24), created in 1964, manifested as a fragile and 
vulnerable-looking robot with human-like qualities. This performative art work 
emerged as a subversion of the popular culture depiction of robots (with super 
human power and intelligence).  
Paik’s work reflects his concern with humanising technology as a process 
to reimagine how they could be applied within art and culture. Through his work 
he engaged audiences in a discussion about their relationship with these 
technologies. This agenda also informs the prototyping practice through the 
notion of creating human-like systems. It is concerned with claiming emergent 
technologies to engage people in a technologically mediated conversation. Like 
Paik, this practice, is rooted in the reimagining of technology in the service of art 
and culture. 
Since the seminal work of the Cybernetic art movement in the 60s, artists 
and designers continue to experiment with art as living and behavioral systems. 
These systems have their own agency and autonomy, and anticipate a future 
where we co-inhabit environments with artificial organisms which incorporate 
different forms of self-expression and communication. This is also informed by 
Ascot’s agenda of art as a form of behaviour requiring audience participation. 
This has now evolved into a synthesis of audience participation within 
behavioural systems as an integral way of making work with emergent 
technologies.  
 
114 
It was with the advent of computer based interactivity in the 1990s that 
pioneers Christa Sommerer and Laurent Mignonneau developed their early 
interactive67 works. Their ‘living system’ ‘A-Volve’ (1993 – 1994) (see figure 25) 
had behavioural and evolutionary attributes which created novel ways for the 
public to interact. Audiences could influence and essentially become part of the 
system by creating creatures and influence their evolution. This artwork emerged 
as a responsive and behavioral dialogue with their participants which looked to a 
future living with artificial life organisms. 
A more recent work experimenting with emergent artificial life is ‘BOB (Bag 
of Beliefs)’ by Ian Cheng (2018), a commission for the Serpentine Gallery (see 
picture 26). Through the creation of a virtual ecosystems of infinite duration for 
multiple AIs inside one single organism, ‘BOB’, he introduces the idea of evolving 
organisms whose growth, behaviour and personalities evolve from interactions 
                                                
67 It is acknowledged that early examples of what can be described as ‘interactive art’ which incorporate 
some levels of audience participation or interaction can be found in the 1920 with works such as  Marcel 
Duchamp’s piece ‘Rotary Glass Plates’  (Paul, 2003). However for the purpose of the inquiry of this thesis, 
a distinction between participatory and interactive art is made. Here interactive art is linked to the advent of 
computer based interactivity in the 1990s.  
Figure 25: A-Volve by Sommerer, C. and Mignonneau, L. (1993 – 1994) [A-life installation]

with visitors. BOB reads facial expression, mirroring it with an animoji version of 
one of its heads and users can take control of BOB and move it around through 
using a smartphone (ibid). However, it has its own agency and chooses whether 
or not to interact with visitors, and also when to stop engaging. Cheng’s work 
draws on principles of video game design, improvisation and cognitive science 
(ibid). The organisms within his work are programmed with behavioural models 
and ‘left to self-evolve without authorial intent, following the unforgiving causality 
found in nature’ (ibid).  
Over twenty-five years apart, Sommerer and Mignonneau’s work A-Volve’ 
and Cheng’s ‘BOB (Bag of Beliefs)’ both create a discourse around the evolution 
of artificial life which invites people to consider their relationship with artificial 
agents. They both create responsive work where the behaviour and interactions 
of an audience affect and become part of an evolving art work. The discourse 
and the process of engaging audiences applied within these works, are relevant 
and informs the practice outlined within this thesis. Whereas the prototypes 
created through this practice would not be classified as artificial life, they have

116 
emergent properties, respond to and evolve with audience-user interaction and 
articulate a future living with human-like evolving systems. 
The appropriation of emergent technologies for artistic practice runs 
throughout the work selected as part of this research context. In particular the 
use of conversational systems is relevant to the authors’ practice. This is inspired 
by the work of Lynn Hersman Leeson. She is renowned for her pioneering use of 
new technologies, in particular conversational systems, to critique emergent 
human-machine relationships. Though her installations Agent Ruby (1998) (see 
figure 27) and DiNA (2004) (see figure 28) she applies conversational 
technologies as a commentary on the potential social relationships between 
humans and machines that can simulate natural life. Agent Ruby launched as an 
art work in 1998, and ran for 12 years generating conversations with ‘her’ 
audiences. Created as an emotive chat bot, she originated from Leeson’s feature 
film ‘Teknolust’ (2002) in which Ruby is one of the protagonists. Leeson’s work 
encourages the audience to take a participatory role as a different way to 
Figure 27: ‘Agent Ruby’s EDream Portal’ [Installation] by Leeson, (1998-2002) 
 
117 
experience film and reflects the artist’s interest in the interaction of fictional and 
virtual characters with real people and situations (ibid).  
Ruby is presented as having a state of mind that is affected by her 
interactions with people and that can learn and develop, increasing its 
conversational abilities and sophistication over time. Whilst the technologies 
applied are relatively basic, the effect lies in the fictional simulation and theatrical 
narrative that augments these systems. Ruby is portrayed as a thinking and 
feeling character which craves to be recognised as a ‘human being’. DiNA (see 
figure 28) was an continuation of Agent Ruby, an ‘animated, artificially intelligent 
female character with speech recognition and live animated facial gestures’ 
(Leeson, 2004). DiNA had with her upgraded functionalities and a new 
personality conducts a more  socio-political conversation. Through inviting people 
to converse both with Ruby and DiNA, Leeson offer participation in a conversation 
about  our symbiosis with the technologies that affects us daily. In so doing she 
lets the audience influence and altering its course.  
Figure 28: ‘DiNA. Artificial Intelligent Agent Installation’  [Installation] by Leeson, (2004) 
 
118 
Cecile B Evans also appropriate a conversational interface for her work 
‘AGNES’. (2016) (see figure 29) Commissioned by the Serpentine Galleries it is 
installed to operate from their website. AGNES has an emotive personality which 
evolves through ‘her’ interactions with online visitors. She attempted to lure 
people in with encouraging interactions triggering people’s emotive responses 
and simultaneously extracting their personal information. Through AGNES Evans 
has devised a manifestation of the privacy and power struggles we are confronted 
with continually in a digital realm.  
 
Evans extends this discourse further in her installation at Tate Liverpool 
‘Sprung a Leak’ (2016) (see figure 30) where visitors are invited into a narrative 
loop that unfolds across multiple screens, robots, a fountain and other sculptural 
elements. Through doing so, she introduces people into a wider discourse as 
observers, exploring the possibilities of collaboration between humans and 
machines and the increasing influence that these emergent technologies have 
on how people feel and act. In subverting the function of conversational 
Figure 29: ‘AGNES’ [Online art work] by Evans (2016) 
 
119 
technologies she engages users in an experiential dialogue about their 
relationship and interactions with her systems. At the same time offers a 
discourse around our relationship with morality and existence, when living largely 
through online environments. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These works by Evans describe a territory for an arts practice that reflects 
not only our relationship to emergent systems, but also what it means to be 
human living with and through these systems. These works and their use of 
emergent technologies, their interactivity, the use of narrative and storytelling to 
invite audiences to reflect, are relevant to the contextual description for the 
practice of this thesis.  
Figure 30: ‘Sprung a Leak’ [Installation] by Evans (2016) 
 
120 
Other works, like ‘I am Echoborg’ by Rik Lander (2019) (see figure 31) also 
applies a narrative as a central method to engage people in its discourse. Within 
this performance a hybrid agent, composed of an actor and a conversational 
agent, delivers a participatory scenario. Through this process, where the 
audience is given ‘genuine’ agency, ‘I am Echoborg’ explores the impact of 
automation on society (ibid). The application of conversational AI technologies 
within a performance-theatre context is essentially a participatory mechanism to 
engage people in a counter-narrative. A pursuit which is central to the practice-
based research inquiry outlined here. 
‘Mute Conversation’ by Yuri Pattinson (2014) (see figure 32) approach the 
role of audience differently. Here the audience become voyeuristic observers of 
a real-time generation of machine - machine communication. Two evolving 
commercial chatbots, one programmed by Pattinson’s using fragments of critical 
texts, and another using an existing chatbot framework which learns from its 
interactions, converse in a human-like manner (ibid). Here the audience observes 
Figure 31: ‘I am Echoborg’ [Performance] by Lander and Hall (2019) Image: Aga (2019) 
 
121 
the textual interaction evolve, littered with emoticons and emotional undertones. 
Each time a visitor visits the chatbots online, new conversation is generated 
which gradually erodes the original scripting of Patterson’s chatbot, replacing it 
by new data it learns from the more advanced social chatbot. Through this 
process Pattinson intentionally removes any human interaction to highlight the 
gradual erosion of the aspirations and hopes we are being sold through data-
driven services and their continuous feedback loops (ibid).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In many ways by removing any audience interaction, Pattinson frames the 
authority and power relationship of these systems. Whereas the application of 
conversational systems for artistic practice outlined above engages people in 
system interactions to influence the work, Mute Conversations subverts this 
participatory aspects, as a tool to generate impact. Simultaneously it plays with 
the notion of our fascination with observing artificial systems acting in a human-
like manner. An aspect which is further illustrated through the playful 
Figure 32: ‘Mute Conversation’ [Online art work]  Pattinson  (2014). [Online 
chatbot] Image from live chat 
 
122 
‘C:>bots.chat’ project by the SeeBotsChat Team (2017) (see figure 33) where 
two Google Home bots, called ‘Vladimir’ and ‘Estragon’ where re-appropriated to 
debate love, life, and their own existence. Streamed live on the video platform 
Twitch gathered over 3.5 million viewers (Telegraph, 2014). This is less about 
applying these technologies for artistic practice, but a poignant illustration of our 
fascination with intelligent systems and the inclination to anthropomorphise these 
technologies.  
 
Marc Böhlen’s ‘Amy and Klara’ (2006) (see figure 30) also puts the 
audience as an observer. Constructed through two conversational robots, here 
the communication is explored not in the common form of social interaction but 
at one of the limits of human communication, swearing. It explores how the 
expectation, construction, and maintenance of norms in conversations are 
affected when transferred to nonhuman entities that are mimicking humans 
(DeSalvo, 2012). ‘Amy and Klara’ needs the other robot to complete itself. If the 
robots do not a perceive pink box in their vicinity, they remain silent. Abstracted

in their embodiment, their behaviour and agonistic design challenging our 
assumptions of human-robot relations.  With their ontologies formed by and 
limited to reading and analysing on-line trivia of life-style magazines and a library 
of foul language, Böhlen (2008) critiques the ongoing AI research pursuit of 
replicating human features in artificial systems. Instead of attempting to create 
synthetic system that looks, feels, acts and sounds like us, he propose to question 
our preconceptions of intelligence re-evaluate the ways in which we engage with 
machines (ibid). 
Bill Vorn and Louis-Philippe Demers also develop abstract robotic forms 
that attempt to trigger a range of internal sensations and instinct in people through 
their anthropomorphic gestures and movement. Designed as cybernetic 
organisms which express metaphoric behaviours they create environments 
consisting of robotic entities that act and react in response to the audience (Vorn 
and Demers, 1997). In their installation ‘LA COUR DES MIRACLES ‘(ibid) first 
exhibited in 1997, they created a space with six different types of artificial 
organisms, each designed to induce empathy. For example, the ‘Limping 
Machine’ stumbles ‘painfully’ and ‘awkwardly’ towards the viewers as a result of 
Figure 34: Amy and Klara by Marc Böhlen (2006) [Installation] 
 
124 
its distorted ‘limbs’ (ibid).  Vorn’s more recent project ‘DSM-VI’ (2012) (see figure 
35) also follows this design framework, creating artificial organisms which 
express symptoms of abnormal psychological behaviours. These manifest as 
‘schizophrenic machines, machines with multiple personalities, autistic 
machines, delirious, phobic and paranoid machines’ (ibid). In spite of their 
abstract form, neither animals nor humans, they trigger the viewer to project 
human-like qualities onto them.  By doing so it brings the audience into its 
discourse, it invites them to immerse themselves in the environment created and 
reflect on what it means to be human.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The work of Dunne and Raby (2007), renowned for coining and developing 
the notion of speculative design, also apply robot like artefacts within their design. 
In their project ‘Technological Dreams Series: No.1, Robots’ (2007) they propose 
Figure 35: ‘DSM-VI’ [Robotic installation] by Vorn (2012) 
 
125 
‘domestic robots’ as technological cohabitants. In their abstract forms, these 
robotic artefacts function as prompts for thinking rather than as functional 
systems. Through this process, Dunne and Raby (ibid) playfully propose 
alternative emotional interactions with robots such as the ‘Needy Robot’ (see 
figure 36) described as;  
Although extremely smart it is trapped in an underdeveloped body and 
depends on its owner to move it about. Neediness is designed into very 
smart products to maintain a feeling of control. Originally, manufacturers 
would have made robots speak human languages, but over time they will 
evolve their own language. You can still hear human traces in its voice. 
 
By presenting these alternative futures they specifically ask the users to consider 
the type of relationship they may want to have with these systems. Though their 
work is observed rather than participated with, they use their speculative props 
as tools for thinking. Activating the viewers intellectual participation as 
mechanisms for stimulating discussion and debate.

Robots’ [Installation] by Dunne and Raby (2007). Image by Per

126 
The works of Laura Beloff also playfully balances the ambiguous space of 
fiction and everyday life, imagination and reality. Often applying irony as a 
strategy to emphasise the complexity ‘between techno-organic human and the 
techno-organic world’ (Beloff, 2012, p.3), she creates networked wearable 
technology art works which she describes as ‘props for real life‘ (ibid, p. 123). 
Through her exploration of the integration of human and technology, she offers a 
perception of technology beyond instrumentality, connecting it back to 
cybernetics and the coupled relationship between an organism and its 
environment. In her work 'The Head' (2005-07) (see figure 37) a wearable 
networked sculpture is proposed as an extension to the wearers body, but which 
Figure 37: 'The Head' [Wearable sculpture] by Laura Beloff (2005-07) 
 
127 
requires public participation via a technological network to succeed. It becomes 
a manifestation of the network of relations between the ‘technical, human and 
non-human artefacts’ (ibid, p130). In so doing it challenges standardised 
perceptions of technology going beyond conventional definitions of functionalism 
to an introduction of the poetic and the speculative.  
These works, outlined above, apply a range of design frameworks and 
engage audiences in different ways, from active participants to voyeuristic 
observers. However, they all appropriate relational things to create a discourse 
around our current and near future relationship with and the effect of emergent 
technologies. Some do this through human-like systems capable of human-like 
communication (voice, gestures or text) whilst others offer more abstract and 
emergent forms of evolutionary or behavioural systems. The depth of 
engagement they facilitate is closely related to the emotive connection they make 
with their audience through their physical and virtual manifestations and 
functionalities.   
In a similar way to how the manufacturing of commercial AI systems exploit 
the human tendency to interpret technology in terms of the social world, the works 
outlined here also apply this as a design strategy. Through triggering people’s 
emotive responses to their artefacts and scenarios, they also deepen their 
engagement with their discourse. Many of these works are designed to invite the 
audience in to participate through interactions which influence the form or 
manifestation of the work itself. Collectively, these works start to outline and 
underpin a practice appropriating relational and behavioural AI systems, for 
artistic production and social action. A practice which invite the people that these 
 
128 
technologies will affect into the process of co-creating speculative artefact and 
scenarios as a process of empowerment. 
 
 
3.2. Prototyping things for participatory 
discourse 
 
The prototyping practice applied within this research inquiry is driven by 
an ambition to increase its engagement and impact through participation. 
Whereas the works that inform this strategy integrate audiences as participants, 
none invite people in as participant in the design of the discourse itself. This 
practice of this thesis propose that to achieve a deeper engagement with a 
discourse one must include people as co-designers, incorporating their views, 
concerns and opinions into the design process. Rather than facilitating near 
future realities for people, my practice, outlined below, argues that creative 
practitioners must design these with the people that these realties will affect.  
It argues that to achieve the goal of triggering critical thinking about the 
near future living with AI powered systems one must engage the intended 
audience as participants in designing the discourse. Otherwise, one falls foul of 
the limitations of the commercial development process of AI systems, as well as 
of many discursive design approaches, this practice-based research inquiry it is 
critiquing. These design processes are largely void of user participation and 
decision making (beyond user-testing for optimising systems functionalities and 
goals, or as receivers of pre-designed critical discourse).  
 
129 
Though this prototyping practice is responsive to and reflective of 
contemporary commercial design methods; their medium (technological 
devolvement and distribution platforms / hardware); their context (data); its 
collaborators, users and institutional partnerships, it is critiquing these 
utilitarian and exclusive methods through the practice. By applying these 
methods and systems it is critiquing, as the material and method of production 
of discourse, it co-creates a participatory mechanism conducted through and 
with conversational systems. It attempts to incorporate these systems into the 
discourse as active ‘participants’, not as sentient systems, but as systems of 
influence, often revealing their bias, influence and power as well as their errors 
and limitations.  
The practice is here developed through participation with people (public 
users of AI technologies) co-creating and embedding conversational artefacts, 
things, with discourse through to eliciting participatory discussions as vehicles for 
engagement. It situates itself within Tharp and Tharp’s (2019, p.102) notion of 
‘discourse-through-design’, borrowing, hybridizing, referencing and embracing 
many incorporated design approaches, such as critical, speculative and 
adversarial design, but also across artforms and forms of activism. The design of 
this practice is not framed by its manifestation as art or design, or neatly within 
any specific design category, but rather how the practice employs design in an 
discursive manner. The practice essentially emerges as design as activism 
contributing to a sociocultural discourse that aims to empower users and propose 
more participatory and ethical design frameworks for conversational systems. 
Davis (2009) proposes that methods such as participatory design could 
account for ethical issues throughout the process of technology design. She 
 
130 
(ibid., p.5) argues that these should be applied to the design of computer 
systems (such as persuasive technology) that are intended to change 
behaviours and attitudes:  
Without participatory design, the designer stands outside of the community 
and intends to change the behavior of community members. With 
participatory design, the persuasive intent comes in part from community 
members who want to change the community’s behavior from within. 
 
The ambition to inform more participatory and ethical design frameworks 
for conversational (and other AI-powered) technologies shapes this practice. It 
engages a range of collaborators; professionals (designers, technology 
developers, artists and researchers) and participants (particularly focused on 
young people and women). These specific groups are targeted in a drive to 
empower those underrepresented or currently lacking voices within technology 
development, as well as those who may have the greatest potential influence 
(and the potential to be influenced the most) by future technologies (ie. young 
people). Through carefully nurturing a shared vision, understanding, set of 
values, authority and distributed ownership, the practice develops an iterative 
collaborative model that enhances the creative potential of the work and the wider 
social impact and discourse.  
At the core of the participatory aspect of this practice is the positioning and 
active engagement with people (as users of AI technologies) as central to a 
discursive practice as well as the commercial development of AI technologies. 
The intention is to uncover and explore human-machine relationships facilitated 
through conversational systems imbued with relationality, persuasiveness, bias 
and hybrid intentions to better understand the factors of influence on a user’s 
subjective reality. In so doing, it aims to activate people to a participatory, action-
 
131 
based and empowering exploration of an envisioned future where one may create 
a balance between commercial, social and creative possibilities of emergent 
technologies.  
 
 
3.1. Prototyping 01: TIWWA – This is Where 
We are  
 
 
The first discursive prototype, This is Where We Are (TIWWA) (Aga, et. al, 
2016), was a data-driven and emotive robotic sculpture with a conversational 
interface.  It was developed in collaboration with a group of five young people as 
participants, from Tate Collective London68, the i-DAT Collective, and InterCity69,

and exhibited for the opening of the new Tate Modern Switch House in London 
June 2016. The physical 6m x 4m sculptural structure (see figure 39 and 40) 
included twenty-four LED screens, a bespoke metal framework, polypropylene 
semi-transparent skin (with perforated code), internal lights with touch sensors, a 
speaker system, three motion sensing Microsoft Kinects, and five windows/OSX 
computers and a Raspberry Pi70. The system (see figure 41) was controlled by 
a networked computational brain assembled through; Node Red71 (processing all 
data flows and triggering system functions), Unity 3D72 (modelling the boid 
swarms in real-time) and Processing73 (controlling vision tracking of user 
interactions and triggering spatial sounds through Pure Data74). This system was 
linked to the autonomous roaming robotic artefacts (powered by an Arduino75 
controlled sensor, sound and lighting system). All of this was feeding on live social 
media data analytics through the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer76, conversations 
with the TIWWA.me Ai chatbot and the behavioural interactions with the live 
audience.

linguistic analysis, conducted through Machine Learning algorithms, to detect and interpret emotional, 
social, and writing tones in text. It is trained on customer support conversation data harvested from Twitter 
and is capable of identifying seven different types of tone: frustration, satisfaction, excitement, politeness, 
impoliteness, sadness and sympathy, as well as detect these sentiments in emojis, emoticons, and slang 
(IBM Cloud, 2019).

This algorithmic sculpture was shaped and driven by the dynamic data 
generated from individuals’ behaviour and interactions, both online and physically 
within the exhibition space. The event had 97,000 visitors over four days and 
generated a continuous flow of interactions with TIWWA, through direct contact 
with its mediated surfaces and roaming artefacts, through online real-time 
interactions through social media, and with the TIWWA AI chatbot. The project 
was realised through funding from Arts Council England, University of Plymouth 
and Tate.  TIWWA was also presented at Technarte, in Bilbao (Aga et al., 2017), 
at EVA 2017 in London, and in its conference proceedings (Aga and Phillips, 
2017).

3.1.1. Intention 
The aim of TIWWA was to explore the persuasiveness and relationality of 
relational things contribution towards demonstrating and testing the hypothesis 
of the perlocutionary effect of conversational systems. It was designed as a 
mechanism to enable the observation of interactions between AI systems 
(relational things) and people (participants and audiences), through the co-
creation of a discursive scenario and artefacts. TIWWA was the first iterative 
prototype in the series of four designed to empower participants (and audiences) 
to (re)evaluate and (re)consider their current and future expectations of and 
relationship with conversational AI systems. The intention was to evaluate this 
prototype and document its impact through informal conversations with and 
observations of audience interactions. Within this the design of this prototype, 
participation in the design process and in dialogue with the designer of the 
discourse was the documentation of impact. 
 
3.1.2. Participatory prototyping  
TIWWA’s scenario emerged through a participatory process, shaped by 
the people taking part; the space, data and systems. This iterative process started 
with a collaborative workshop introducing the conceptual framework, testing 
conversational technologies and nurturing the amalgamation of ideas, 
perspectives and desires. This was delivered through a mix of future gazing and 
hands-on experimentation, followed by a series of collaborative sessions where 
ideas were iteratively prototyped and tested - going from paper prototypes to fully 
working scenarios and artefacts. Though these prototypes were tested for 
functionality and user experience (as required for fully working prototype 
 
136 
systems), the onus was also on testing the ability to support the generation of 
discourse and follow up debate. This process was conducted with the participants 
as another layer of dialogue and engagement as well as a method to ensure they 
felt ownership of the discourse created. 
The participatory prototyping process was carefully planned and facilitated 
to empower all participants (the group of 5 young people) and the experts 
(collaborators from the i-DAT Collective, Intercity and Tate Modern) with an equal 
level of authority and contribution. To do this, a shared vision was created and 
reflected in the title of the work; ‘This is Where We Are’, goals and development 
frameworks were collectively agreed and skills, interests and desires were 
shared. The process was facilitated in a role as producer-artist/designer- 
collaborator; directing the integrity of the project and the conceptual framing, 
managing and supporting people, the project and partners, and producing the 
participation and collaboration to ensure each stakeholder’s area of expertise and 
interest was visible, embedded and recognised. This took place through physical 
workshops and development sessions, communication through a Slack channel 
(online communication and collaborative working platform), regular updates from 
all participants and collective decision making. To balance the power 
relationships within the group, in which ‘experts’ had the skills of production and 
participants were largely novices (in terms of technology development) a 
mentorship was established. Through pairing participants up with experts, around 
their area of interest and skill-set (existing and desired), they gained new skills 
and deepened their engagement with the collaborative process. Simultaneously, 
it facilitated a deeper understanding of the AI software and systems, methods of 
production and the discourse itself.  
 
137 
 
3.1.3. Scenario, artefact and system design 
The physical manifestation of TIWWA (see figure 39 and 40) incorporated 
the design and aesthetic (physical) of the new iconic Tate Modern Switch House 
building (see figure 42); its’ geometrical structure, its’ material (emitting and 
absorbing light) and its’ social activity (physical and virtual). Through a symbiosis 
between people, algorithms and data, the model of the sculptural artefact was 
derived from the architecture and life of the building. It became a materialised 
and dynamic data-sculpture, a geometric large-scale polygon shard and smaller 
scattered fragments, as if the building was dynamically inverting itself. TIWWA’s 
surface represented the algorithmic process and data, engraved as a perforated 
code. Within this, real-time inputs and outputs influenced the sound, visuals and 
behavioural dynamics, as a confluence of systems, people and data. 
Simultaneously, the system’s conversational interface (see figure 43) created as 
a relational chatbot, extended its behavioural and audio-visual interactions. 
Designed with a pre-scripted and playful narrative, the chatbot responded to user 
requests and in return prompted them to think about their relationship with 
relational and data-driven technologies. 
 
138 
 
 
 
 
Following the conceptual framing of the work, the scenario and artefacts 
emerged from the collective imagination of the participants and collaborators. 
Manifesting as a system with an abstracted personality and anthropomorphic 
qualities; emotive behaviour patterns, movement (roaming robotic fragments) 
and communication (conversational interface and surface patterns), the ambition 
was to entice the audience into play and interaction whilst simultaneously 
subverting this invitation through persuading and directing people. The ambition 
was for the hybrid intentions of these systems to emerge with their 
persuasiveness, woven and embedded within its algorithmic complexity and 
largely invisible to the user. The intention was that as the system directed a users’ 
movement in the space and interactions with its surfaces, audiences would begin 
Figure

House 
illustration (Hayes Davidson and Herzog & de 
Meuron, 2014) 
 
Figure 43: The TIWWA chatbot interface (Aga, et 
al. 2016) 
 
139 
to question who was directing these interactions and their intentions (the user, 
the system, the designers or the manufacturers of these systems?).  
The dynamic qualities which informed the overall system design (see 
figure 41) and interactions (see figure 44, 45 and 46), were rooted in and 
continuously responsive to data generated by human activity. The animated and 
responsive texture on TIWWA’s surface was generated through a process of 
scraping and curating textures from sentiment searches, (searches on the 
relation between artworks and emotive word tags), from the Tate Art Collection 
database (see figure 47). These textures were then processed and triggered in 
relation to the mood and behaviour of people, (classified as anger, anticipation, 
disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust). The data set to trigger this was 
harvested through people’s interactions with TIWWA’s online chatbot interface 
(see figure 43), Twitter feeds relating to the Switch House or the installation itself, 
and audiences’ interactions in the gallery space. Flocking textures as fragments 
on the sculptural surface represented these collective sentiments through their 
texture, colour, movement and sound generated.  
Figure 44: TIWWA social data input visualisation (Aga, et al., 2016) 
 
140 
 
The use of flocking textures critically drew a reference from Reynolds 
(1987) seminal work on ‘boids’ simulating the first computer model of group 
animal motion within artificial life. The behaviour of these flocks was based on 
the behaviour Reynolds (ibid.) put forward based on three simple rules; each boid 
moves to avoid crowding with its neighbours, matches and coordinates its 
movements with its neighbours, and moves to gather with the others. By doing

Figure 45: TIWWA user behavioural data input visualisation (Aga, et al., 2016) 
 
141 
so it created a real-time audio-visual snapshot of peoples overriding emotive 
responses in real-time. At the same time through its abstracted anthropomorphic 
qualities, the movement of its human-seeking robotic fragments, its audio-visual 
emotive displays switching through the eight system emotions (see figure 47) and 
its conversational interfaces, attempted to trigger audiences to project human-
like attributes onto the artefacts.  
 
 
3.1.4. Observations and evaluation of practice 
Both the creation of TIWWA’s sculptural artefacts, as well as the systems 
driving them were forged through interplay between data sets, algorithms and 
people. Environmental, behavioural and social media data was harvested and 
represented in real time as a dynamic image of an abstracted artificial reality on 
its surface. It invited audiences to play (see figure 48 and 50), seduced them to 
interact (physically and virtually) whilst simultaneously harvesting and learning, 
predicting and attempting to influence their behaviour and interactions.  
With TIWWA’s static and roaming sculptural fragments, as connected 
algorithmic extensions of the system, it affected the behaviour and movement of 
Figure 47: TIWWA’s eight system emotions and sentiment textures generated from the Tate 
Collection data base (Aga, et al., 2016) 
 
142 
people in the space. At the same time it also appeared to affected the way people 
related these extensions and TIWWA itself. Through displaying a playful 
behaviour, both through its surface as well as through the roaming fragments, 
TIWWA appeared to trigger people’s social interaction frameworks. As the 
ambition of the work was to engage people with the project’s discourse, the 
collaborating team (including the participants) was present, actively engaging 
audiences during the week-long exhibition. The team worked alongside the 
system, its conversational interface and interactive surfaces, to elicit thoughts, 
conversations and speculations. Overall approximately 97,000 people visited 
TIWWA across the four days it was live and the system processed and responded 
to around 150,000 tweets.

To reveal and challenge some of the technological barriers between 
increasingly complex AI systems and their users, the installation and its 
algorithmic systems and technologies was opened and hacked live during the 
Figure 49: TIWWA, live performance and TIWWA take over by Adam Williams, (Aga, et al., 2016) 
(Image: Tate Learning) 
Figure 50: TIWWA, audience interaction, (Aga, et al., 2016) (Image: Tate Learning) 
 
144 
exhibit. This took place as a mix between performers taking over the installation 
as a performance surface (see figure 49) and the collaborators and participants 
performing live system hacks and iterations (see figure 51 and 52). This active 
participation and engagement challenged the context and preconceptions of 
audiences visiting Tate Modern’s Switch House.  
Whilst TIWWA entered a predefined arts space with an audience primed 
for the act of observing art, from shallow to deeper levels, it was designed for and 
located within the Tate Exchange space on the 5th floor of the Switch House. This 
functions as a space for learning, engagement and conversations, rather than as 
formal gallery spaces. This allowed the work to become more interactive, tactile, 
explorative and conversational. This was critical to the development of the work 
as a discursive and dialogue-driven speculation, that engaged audiences online 
and offline in interactions with the system itself. The ability of the prototype to 
Figure 51: TIWWA, live hacking, modification and iteration, (Aga, et al., 2016) (Image: Tate Learning) 
 
145 
augment and insert itself as a memory fragment within its user’s imagination 
became dependant on the level of engagement.  
  
TIWWA created a mirror of people’s individual and collective physical and 
online interactions. The data, generated by people in real-time driving the 
behaviour and mood of the system, was driving the human-system interplay, but 
doing so ubiquitously and hidden, and therefore often unnoticed, becoming a 
symbolic representation of how these systems are integrated into our lives. The 
observed reactions of the audience went from an initial state of intrigue hesitant 
to touch and interact, to a state of playful and inquisitive tactile and physical 
interactions with TIWWA’s surfaces and robotic artefacts. Audiences were 
encouraged to touch by other audience members or the TIWWA collaborators 
and participants. 
 
Figure 52: TIWWA, live hacking, modification and iteration, (Aga, et al., 2016) (Image: Tate Learning) 
 
146 
Through conversations with audience members interacting with TIWWA, 
it became evident that people quickly started to project human-like qualities on to 
the artefacts. People would describe it has having its own intentions, moods and 
behaviour. The built-in personality and behaviour cues were enough for the 
audience to anthropomorphise TIWWA’s software system. Even though 
TIWWA’s embodiment was abstracted and metaphoric it quickly appeared to 
become what Turkle (2007b, p. 62) describes as an evocative object. People 
almost instantly displayed affection and tactile play with the sculptural artefacts 
(see figure 53). Within the first day of the exhibition opening the roaming robotic 
artefacts was being called ‘the babies’ and the larger artefact the ‘mummy’ by 
audience members. When one of the artefacts broke and had to be opened up 
and fixed, audiences displayed a mix of responses from intrigue to empathy and 
concern for its well-being. 
Audience members appeared to quickly default to human-human 
communication models in their interactions with the chatbot, as well as with the 
artefacts. This took place in spite of TIWWA’s abstracted forms of disembodied 
Figure 53: Audience interaction with TIWWA, (Photo credit: Tate Learning) 
 
147 
acts. During the exhibition audiences appeared to show genuine concern when 
social media data triggered TIWWA to display its ‘angry’ emotive state; glowing 
red, with rapid and erratic flocking boids and deep bass sounds. People would 
ask the TIWWA team members if they upset TIWWA, why TIWWA was feeling 
angry or how they could cheer it up. It became visible, as identified by McTear et 
al. (2016), that the display of nonverbal behaviours influenced people’s 
engagement and likeability of a system.  
Compared to the large amounts of visitors and social media interactions, 
TIWWA’s conversational interface only had 2065 unique conversations. The 
physical embodiment of the prototype became the overriding platform for 
interaction, whereas the conversational interface required people to access the 
chatbot on the TIWWA website via their digital devices. However, it was through 
the interactions with the chatbot that audience members first started to ask 
questions around these systems’ hybrid intentions and its influence on people 
interacting. With language introduced as an interface between the system and 
the users people began questioning the system and testing its ‘human-like’ 
narrative qualities.  
TIWWA attempted to challenge traditional thinking and appropriate 
emergent AI technologies for engagement in discourse rather than commerce. It 
initiated a nascent conversation with people about current and near future 
human-machine 
relationships 
through 
participation 
with 
and 
through 
conversational and data-driven systems. It activated its participants to critically 
engage with their own and the wider public agenda around our reliance on 
computational systems, supporting them to develop an understanding and skill in 
 
148 
developing these technologies and system. The participation of the young people 
from Tate and the collaborators was in itself the measure of impact. 
 
3.1.5. Summary of learning and new knowledge  
 
TIWWA’s collaborative creation, development and delivery were 
substantial activities and an informative part of this practice-based research 
enquiry. The observations from this prototype was the first step in the iterative 
process of testing and documenting the hypothesis of the perlocutionary effect of 
conversational systems. Simultaneously, this was the first activity, in the series 
of creating four prototypes, testing the potential of a participatory method within 
a discursive design approach to deepen engagement with the emergent theme 
and discourse. Here, participation was the measurement of impact. The focus 
was on activating young people, a priority and objective of this practice,  to 
generate dialogue between people (between participants – experts; participants 
– audiences; experts – audiences, audiences – audiences) about and through AI 
systems. This is documented through the traceable participation in practice and 
interactions with the prototype. The interest was not in measuring the content of 
these interactions but in documenting and observing them taking place.  
TIWWA delivered against the following objectives of this practice-based 
research inquiry: 
• Evidencing the relationality of relational things:  
Through displaying a playful behaviour, both through its surface as well as 
through the roaming fragments, TIWWA appeared to trigger people’s 
social interaction frameworks. In so doing it documents that even through 
the simulation of abstracted human-like qualities, relational artefacts 
trigger users to apply their understanding of social relationships to their 
 
149 
interactions with relational systems. This reaffirms people’s susceptibility 
to a design strategy which applies human-like attributes in AI systems. 
 
• Creating actual and traceable participation in discourse: 
The participation of five young people from Tate and the collaborators was 
in itself the measure of impact and the documentation engagement with 
discourse. This was the first  documentation of the potential of a 
prototyping practice, with a participatory method, to encourage deeper 
discourse and engagement.  
 
The observations from TIWWA which inform the following Emoti-OS 
prototype are: 
• Design strategy: 
Specifically apply a design strategy that exploits the relationality of 
conversational systems through the design of personality and affect. 
• Context and location of participants: 
Focus on designing this both with and for young people 
• Creating actual and traceable participation in discourse: 
Further test the impact of a discursive design approach extended with a 
participatory method and consider the aspect of actual and traceable 
participation.

The second prototype, Emoti-OS (Aga et al., 2017 and 2018), iterates the 
findings from TIWWA and analyses the design of relationality of conversational 
systems through simulated affect, personality and collective (artificial) emotional 
intelligence. Developed in collaboration with a group of pupils at Plymouth School 
of Creative Arts77, i-DAT Collective, Intercity and Control Frenzy78, Emoti-OS 
drew people into a brief conversation about how they felt whilst simultaneously 
reflecting the collective mood of those to whom it spoke.  It was installed as two 
iterations, 1.0 and 2.0. Emoti-OS 1.0, designed for the Plymouth School of 
Creative Art, was the primary focus. It was exhibited from the 13th November - 
19th December 2017. Emoti-OS 2.0 was designed after the first iteration and

customised for Tate Exchange London where it was exhibited from the 31st 
January - 2nd February 2018.  
The system (see figure 57) had two main components; an online chatbot 
(see figure 55) and a physical installation (see figure 56). The system powering 
both platforms used Dialogflow79, a conversational platform, to construct the 
conversational system and the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer service to extract and 
interpret emotional tones from the conversational data generated. It also used 
Node Red for connecting the different platforms and aggregating the emotive 
status updates from users. The physical installation (see figure 58) comprising a 
Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno with data input buttons and a screen displayed 
the system question of the day (as generated by the pupils), the seven Emoti-OS 
emotive emojis and related shares (the number of votes/presses it has had in 
response to the question of the day).  
Emoti-OS had 37,670 ‘emotional’ user interactions (emotive shares) and 
1,372 unique conversations in the period it was live. The project was also 
presented at the Nesta conference ‘What does artificial intelligence really mean 
for our education system? Envisioning education by algorithm’ (Reith, 2018a), on 
the Nesta Blog ‘Meet Emoti-OS: The chatbot helping to empower pupils’ (Reith, 
2018b) and featured in the Nesta report ‘Educ-AI-tion Rebooted? Exploring the 
future of artificial intelligence in schools and colleges (Baker, et al., 2019).

3.2.1. Intention 
The aim of Emoti-OS 1.0 was to extend the inquiry conducted through 
TIWWA, and focus on testing and demonstrating relationality of conversational 
systems through a design strategy that applies simulated affect, personality 
and collective (artificial) emotional intelligence. The intention was to again 
design a prototype with young people, but also this time for young people. 
Plymouth School of the Creative Arts was therefore chosen as the main site 
and collaborating partner for the project. This delivers against the objective of 
this research inquiry of engaging those who are generally unrepresented in 
technology development (with a focus in particular young people and women). 
Figure 57: Emoti-OS system diagram (Aga, et al., 2017) 
 
154 
The design of Emoti-OS 1.0 was rooted in the observations and learning 
from TIWWA which demonstrated people’s tendency to project human-like 
qualities and social attributes onto relational things. Whereas TIWWA facilitated 
fleeting relational interactions through abstract behavioural cues, the intention 
with Emoti-OS was to facilitate social conversations with people through repeat 
interactions. The intention was to test a design strategy optimised for relationality 
to further demonstrate the hypothesis of the perlocutionary effect. Whereas 
TIWWA was designed as a physical and tangible embodied artefact, the intention 
was to design Emoti-OS as virtual character with a conversational and affective 
interface. The aim was to further explore the relationality of a screen-based 
system. 
Whereas TIWWA attempted to position the prototype as an 
amalgamation of all the collaborators’ (experts and participants) ideas, desires 
and vision, Emoti-OS 1.0 and 2. 0 intentionally placed the participants at the 
centre of the design process, with the experts more in a facilitating role. The 
ambition was to explore if this could increase the relevance and ownership of 
the intended discourse. 
Emoti-OS 1.0 and 2. 0 also set out to evidence actual and traceable 
participation in the discourse put forward through using the data generated by 
the conversational system. The participation in designing the discourse, and 
related scenario and artefacts, was here the measurement of impact. The 
intention was not to evaluate the qualia of this data, but to use it to document 
participation and any evidence of a perlocutionary effect.  
Emoti-OS 2.0 was embedded with the design intentions of the first 
iteration. Emoti-OS 1.0, but was redesigned to nurture shorter, single-event 
 
155 
interactions with a transient audience. The aim was to continue to explore the 
role of relationality and simulated affect within emergent interactions between 
people and conversational AI systems. However, whereas Emoti-OS 1.0 was 
designed to nurture repeat interactions and to build relations with users over time, 
this system was designed for single interactions. Emoti-OS 2.0 intended to 
deepen the functionality of the system’s simulated empathy and emotion 
recognition to trigger a more direct discourse with the user/audience about their 
engagement with affective Ai systems. It attempted to be more provocative, also 
introducing the notion of persuasiveness of conversational systems.  
 
3.2.2. Participatory prototyping 
Conceptually framed by the aims and intentions outlined in the section 
above, the prototyping process was responsive to the participating pupils from 
PSCA, the tangible (structure, inhabitants, physical and online interactions) and 
intangible (the ethos of the school, the thoughts, feelings and the moods of the 
inhabitants) attributes of the school itself. It was also reflective of PSCA being a 
technology-enabled school in which pupils are encouraged to use and access a 
range of online devices (such as phones, iPads, laptops work stations) as part of 
the learning environment. Prototyping began with a hands-on workshop at the i-
DAT Collective, Plymouth University, during which the participants were 
introduced to different conversational software and hardware, with the ambition 
to provide a deeper understanding of the technologies and data behind these 
interfaces. This was followed up by a workshop at Plymouth School of Creative 
Arts where nascent perspectives, desires and ideas were co-developed.  
 
156 
This prototyping process was led by the pupils, in conversation with the 
wider school population, and facilitated by the collaborating experts. It was 
designed to give the pupils more authority and ownership within the idea 
generation and design, leading to greater engagement with the discourse. From 
these workshops the tension between the power structures within the school and 
the limited ability for pupils to express how they felt individually and collectively 
was explored. This led to a series of paper prototypes, tested through focus 
groups with the wider school population, led by the participating pupils, which 
informed the final system design, conversational structure and installation build. 
This process was again developed through a process of collaborative mentoring 
where participants were paired up with and mentored by the participating experts. 
 
3.2.3. Scenario, artefact and system design 
The first iteration, Emoti-OS 1.0, emerged from (and was driven) by the 
specific context of Plymouth School of Creative Arts and the collaboration with 
the group of pupils. Whereas five students participating directly with the 
prototyping and the design of the discourse, they were directly facilitating a 
wider engagement with their peers, rendering the wider pupil population in the 
school more as participants than audiences.  
The second iteration, Emoti-OS 2.0, was framed by the specific context of 
being installed at Tate Exchange at Tate Modern Switch House as part of 
Plymouth College of Art’s (2018) Factory Settings exhibition. Taking over the Tate 
Exchange space for three days the exhibition offered participatory activities and 
interventions questioning the future of creative learning.  
 
157 
Emoti-OS was designed as a speculative system to gauge the collective 
mood of the population of pupils within the school, in real time, informed by the 
pervasive use of emojis, texting and chatbots from across the school youth 
culture. This was to be done through emotive status updates (shares) and a 
chatbot which could pose and respond to questions to users about how they felt. 
The intention was also that the Emoti-OS participants and their peers (the school 
pupils) could use this system as a mechanism to pose questions to the school 
population around issues they felt were important. The ambition was that this 
would enable the visualisation, in real time, of the collective feelings of the pupils, 
and therefore create a better awareness and empathy of pupil’s collective 
emotive states. Through pupil-led questions, this would empower them to 
express their feelings in response to school related matters. Underpinning these 
intentions was an ambition, driven by the pupils, to challenge the power structures 
within the school. Emoti-OS therefore became a way to explore the appropriation 
of conversational systems to empower pupils to express how they feel and see 
how others felt, and in so doing generate a wider discourse amongst the school 
population around these issues. To enable all pupils to express themselves freely 
and to remove barriers to interactions it was collectively decided not to have any 
registration, log-in or other forms of user-identification.  
Emoti-OS had to balance the need for privacy and anonymity with the 
requirement to ensure safeguarding of pupils, to ensure it could respond to and 
follow up disclosures made through the chat interface that could lead to harm. 
This was done by training the chatbot with a list of ‘harm words’ generated in 
consultation with the PSCA school safeguarding team. The safeguarding feature 
would intervene when a harm word was triggered and the users were asked if 
 
158 
they would like to be forwarded to the safeguarding team at PSCA. This provided 
another layer of child protection. Ethical considerations, including the application 
of ethical approval of research to University of Plymouth, were considered and 
adhered to throughout the prototyping process.  (See Appendix II for the Emoti-
OS Information Sheet and Consent Form). A clear and transparent privacy 
statement (Aga et al., 2017b) of its purpose, and the use and storage of data was 
integrated into the online system.  
The identity (see figure 54) of Emoti-OS was based on a confluence of the 
manifestation and social use of emojis, (ideograms and smileys used within 
messaging platforms), and the architectural shape of PSCA itself. The personality 
design of Emoti-OS was encoded to be reflective of a young person (12 – 16 
years of age); supportive and upbeat, with the capability of simulating seven 
different emotive states (joy, excitement, fear, sadness, anger, disgust, 
confusion, as illustrated in figure 58).

To facilitate the emotive shares (responses) to questions posed by of 
Emoit-OS, the installation had a console with seven physical buttons 
corresponding to each Emoti-OS emoji. This enabled large scale interaction in 
which the pupils would respond to the question displayed with an emoji 
corresponding to their emotive response. The system also had a dashboard (see 
figure 59) with real-time analytics on user emotive shares, conversations and 
responses to specific questions. The online chatbot (see figure 55) also facilitated 
the emotive shares (responses) to questions posed through its online 
conversational interface. Similar to the physical installation, it displayed the 
Figure 59: Emoti-OS dashboard (Aga, et. al., 2017) 
 
160 
overriding mood of Emoti-OS (representative of the collective mood of its users), 
but also engaged users through dialogue.  
The conversational structure was designed to first ask the user to share 
how they were feeling, (emotive share), followed by a question around why they 
felt that way. The user could then choose to continue the conversation entering 
a small talk mode where the user leads the conversation freely around any topic. 
The direction of the conversational content and topics covered was produced by 
the participants, who also adapted and modified it based on feedback from their 
peers. 
The overall system structure and interactions for Emoti-OS 2.0 was similar 
to those of its earlier iteration. However, the change in context from PSCA to the 
Tate Exchange led to an adaptation to its conversational structure, and goals for 
interactions. The conversational aspect of this version was more provocative and 
based on single interactions rather than the repeat interactions of Emoti-OS 1.0. 
After the initial emotive share the system was designed to direct the dialogue 
through three questions around the future of creative learning. It then ended the 
conversation with a playful and emotive exchange, in which it offered its own 
emotive interpretation of how the user was feeling. This was conducted through 
analysing the dialogue the user had exchanged with Emoti-OS using IBM’s 
Watson Tone Analyzer, and attempted to interject the notion of these systems’ 
persuasiveness and authority. 
 
161 
3.2.4. Observations and evaluation of practice 
The Emoti-OS 1.0 atrium installation (see figure 60) had 37,153 emotive 
shares when it was live and the online chatbot (see figure 55) had 1,293 shares 
and conversations. In the first weeks of launching the physical installation it 
processed on average 2000 emotive shares a day, and then settled around 1000 
shares a day until the project completed. Through informal observations of users 
interacting with both, it became clear that the atrium installation was in a space 
where all pupils passed in the morning and also where they all had lunch, so there 
was an ease of access and minimal barriers to interactions (such as access to a 
device and login on to the Emoti-OS site to speak to the chatbot). The installation 
became an interface for collective interaction and discussion. Groups of pupils 
would gather and hit emotive share buttons, express opinions and observations 
around the overall collective sentiments displayed and questions asked. It 
became a group activity whereas the chatbot became an individual activity with 
a higher threshold for engagement.

(Aga, et. al., 2017) (Image: PSCA) 
 
162 
The engagement with Emoti-OS was facilitated by the participants and a 
group of twenty pupils who became project ambassadors. They initiated dialogue 
with the school population about the intentions of the project as well as their 
feelings towards the system itself. Through this peer-led and informal collection 
of people’s opinions and feelings about the system itself, the conversational 
system and dialogue was iterated and refined. It became evident that pupils were 
engaged in discussions on a daily basis around why Emoti-OS was feeling a 
specific emotion that day. However, rather than creating a discourse around this 
being reflective of the collective emotion of the school population, Emoti-OS was 
treated as a person with feelings and behaviours. From the participants’ feedback 
it became evident that the system became a life-like ‘being’ for whom the 
population ‘cared’, and which generated an awareness and empathy of its 
emotive states, rather than the pupils’ collective feelings. It also became a tool in 
activating the pupils in terms of generating discussions and feelings about school 
matters raised through the questions posed through the Emoti-OS interface.  
Figure 61: Emoti-OS emotive badges (Aga, et al., 2018) 
 
 
163 
The Emoti-OS 1.0 online chatbot was designed for conversational 
interactions instigating a dialogue with the user around their own feelings and 
those toward specific school issues raised by their peers. Through observing the 
conversational data generated three conversational strands emerge (see the 
Appendix lV: ‘Emoti-OS 1.0 Conversational data sample’ for examples). The first 
two are categorised as shallow interactions where the user appears to be testing 
the human-like qualities and the ‘intelligence’ of the system, followed by a series 
of playful exchanges, often with jokes or other forms of expressives. The third 
strand appears to be relationally deeper; involving longer exchanges and contain 
utterances indicating that the user relates to and confides in the system – this 
was often expressed as being happy to be able to talk to Emoti-OS - ‘You have 
helped a bunch’. 
 
Figure 62: Emoti-OS installation at Tate Exchange (Aga, et al., 2018) 
 
164 
Emoti-OS 2.0 (see figure 62) was installed at Tate Exchange for three 
days, and generated 462 emotive shares and 55 conversations with its chatbot. 
This iteration engaged a transient audience in short interactions. After asking the 
user three questions around their feelings towards creative learning and Ai 
systems, the system gave them feedback on their emotional state. This was done 
through integrating the functionality of sentiment analytics (IBM Watson Tone 
Analyzer) analysing the user dialogue for emotional tones (see the Appendix VII: 
Emoti-OS 2.0 Sentiment Analysis System Response for examples).  
Emoti-OS 2.0 explored the notion of persuasiveness and simulated 
emotion recognition to trigger a more direct discourse with the user/audience 
about their engagement with affective AI systems. Observations from the 
conversational data from these short interactions (see the Appendix V: Emoti-OS 
2.0 conversational data sample for examples) illustrates that the majority of the 
users appeared to perceive the systems as having little or no relationality.  The 
majority seemed to view and communicate with it much more as a user survey 
than a relational artefact, as was observed with Emoti-OS 1.0. In comparison with 
this version, Emoti-OS 2.0 did not have the same buy-in and ownership by its 
users. The audience/users here had not been involved in a participatory design 
process and therefore had no ownership of the discourse being made. They were 
also transient, meaning there were no basis for nurturing repeat and or deeper 
relational interactions. The overall discourse and relevance of Emoti-OS 2.0 
became somewhat lost in the myriad of activities taking place within the Tate 
Exchange space. Compounding this, whereas TIWWA, had embodied artefacts 
enticing the user into play, Emoti-OS 2.0 required the user to have the initiative 
to access the chatbot on their own device or the iPad provided. 
 
165 
In particular with Emoti-OS 1.0 with its; virtual embodiment, emoji-like 
appearance, relational design, simulated affect and understanding, and in spite 
of frequent incorrect linguistic responses, it became evident that users quickly 
attribute personality, intelligence, and emotion to it (as commonly seen with 
human-agent interactions as previously outlined and evidenced by Fogg and 
Nass, 1997a; Fogg and Nass, 1997b; Nass, Moon, et al. 1997; Kiesler and 
Sproull 1997; Reeves and Nass 1999; Turkle, 1995, 2007b and Weizenbaum 
1976).  
The conversational data from Emoti-OS 1.0 demonstrated that many users 
continued long dialogues with the system, with over 20 conversational turns. This 
demonstrates people’s susceptibility to a design strategy that exploits our 
tendency to relate to artefacts that display human-like attributes, even though 
these artefacts are as Turkle describe (2007b) without true understanding or 
empathy. It appears, as Turkle (ibid) notes, not to be about whether these 
systems really have emotion or intelligence, but about what they evoke in us. She 
(2005a; 2007b) found that children have a greater tendency than adults to 
perceive computational objects as being ‘alive’ or ‘sort of alive’.  This, she (2007b, 
p.507) explains is not a result of their functionality but of ‘children’s emotional 
connection to them and fantasies about how the objects might be feeling about 
them’.  
Emoti-OS 1.0 succeeded in generating discourse through its participatory 
methods. It also succeeded in engaging users, through designing relationality 
through its relevance, personality, levels of embodiment, conversational ability 
and simulated emotional awareness. However, where this version succeeded, 
Emoti-OS 2.0 was less effective. Without the same sense of relevance, 
 
166 
ownership and repeat interactions, it lost its relationality and became little more 
than a user satisfaction survey, whereas user interactions with Emoti-OS 1.0 
went beyond the intended function, eliciting secrets and desires; becoming an 
‘other’ which some pupils began to confide in and rely on. 
The overall engagement of the participants in the central discourse of 
Emoti-OS was largely evidenced through their role in the design, exhibition and 
audience engagement process. Implementing a participatory prototyping process 
that empowered and encouraged their ownership increased their engagement 
and the impact of the project’s discourse. Feedback from the focus groups led by 
PSCA project lead and Computing Lead Angus Reith (summary of feedback is 
found in the Appendix VI: Emoti-OS Participant Feedback Summary) 
demonstrates that this has been an influential project and experience for their 
pupils. They found that Emoti-OS became a talking point amongst them and their 
peers, both as a tool to give them a student voice, but also as an intervention to 
talk about feelings as well as their own use of Ai technologies to communicate 
these. The fact that the project was a student-led initiative, it was felt that it had 
a much greater buy-in and resonance with the student body than it would have 
had it been an external research project. He explains; 
With that student engagement therefore came meaningful human-
machine dialogue and in fact a tool in itself to prompt dialogue. The pupils 
found that it created a better awareness and empathy of how people were 
feeling, in particular in relation to school matters. 
 
Reith explained that they also found that pupils readily displayed an 
emotional bond with the Emoti-OS conversational system, evidenced in what they 
found as an often ‘warm, genuine and thoughtful conversation’ in many 
interactions. Through observing the conversational data and speaking to their 
 
167 
peers, Emoti-OS provides a non-human (and non-judgmental) sounding board; 
the participants believe there was a therapeutic nature to some of the 
conversations. In interacting with the system, pupils seemed to be navigating 
their own emotional territory and many demonstrated a degree of closure at the 
end of the chat with Emoti-OS. With the Emoti-OS project coming to an end, the 
participating pupils reported that their peers missed ‘having it around’ and wanted 
to know if they could still ‘talk to it and keep in touch’. 
 
3.2.5. Summary of learning and new knowledge  
Designed through a strategy that exploited the relationality of 
conversational systems through personality, simulated affect and emotional 
intelligence, Emoti-OS 1.0 demonstrated how users attribute human-like qualities 
to a system, and reaffirms the hypothesis of the perlocutionary effect. This was 
also evidenced through TIWWA, however Emoti-OS with is virtual rather than 
physical embodiment, abstracted emoji-like character and conversational 
interface, was able to engage users in deeper, emotive and repeat social 
interactions. This evidence what Reeves and Nass (1999) identified as people’s 
tendency to project human characteristics on non-human things, and not as 
Turkle (2007b, p 62) argues based on their ‘intelligence, consciousness, or 
reciprocal pleasure in relating’ but rather in ‘their ability to push our Darwinian 
buttons. 
The focus of Emoti-OS was to designing this prototype both with and for 
young people, activating them to generate dialogue with each other and their 
peers, about and through the AI systems. The participation in the practice was 
observed and demonstrated through the system itself (conversational data and 
 
168 
number of interactions). This delivered against the overall aim of this research-
based inquiry, both engaging young people and extending the ability to 
demonstrate actual and traceable engagement with the discourse.  
Emoti-OS delivered against the following objectives of this practice-based 
research inquiry: 
• Evidencing the relationality of relational things that talk:  
Emoti-OS evidenced the perlocutionary effect, in particular the 
relationality, of relational things that talk. With its; virtual embodiment, 
emoji-like appearance, relational design, simulated affect it understanding 
triggered people to apply their understanding of social relationships to their 
interactions.  
• Design strategy: 
Emoti-OS evidenced and reaffirmed people’s susceptibility to a design 
strategy that exploits the relationality of conversational systems through 
the design of system attributes; personality and affect. 
• Context and location of participants: 
Emoti-OS prioritised the engagement of young people in its design and 
discourse both with and for young people. 
• Creating actual and traceable participation in discourse: 
The participation of five young people from PSCA and the wider  
participation of their peers was in itself the measure of impact and the 
documentation engagement with discourse. This was further extended to 
evidencing actual and traceable participation through the interaction and 
conversational data generated through the system interface. This was the 
second documentation of the potential of a prototyping practice, with a 
participatory method, to encourage deeper discourse and engagement.  
 
The observations from Emoti-OS which informed the following WRAI 
prototype are: 
• Context of participants: 
 
169 
Prioritised the engagement of self-identifying women who are substantially 
underrepresented in the development of AI, and challenge stereotyping 
within conversational AI.  
• Empower participants to challenge, discuss and participate in 
technology development: 
Focus on empowering people to challenge, discuss and participate in 
technology development by creating opportunities for hands-on 
technology development and design. 
• Claim emergent conversational AI technologies 
Claim emergent conversational AI technologies with their target users for 
new forms of creative practice, which has social debate as a fundamental 
goal and desired outcome, to disrupt the commercial development of 
unethical and exclusive AI systems. 
 
 
 
3.3. Prototype 03: Women Reclaiming AI 
 
Figure 63:  Women Reclaiming AI identity (Aga and Manton, 2018) 
 
              Women Reclaiming AI (Aga and Manton, 2018) was a collaborative AI 
Voice Assistant and AI-activism project made by and for self-identifying women 
to challenge stereotyping and bias in commercial conversational AI 
 
170 
developments. The system itself (see figure 66) consisted of two interfaces; a 
Google Home Assistant (see figure 64) and a chatbot on the WRAI website (see 
figure 65). The project reclaims AI for artistic innovation and social action rather 
than commercial exploitation. It responded to the lack of female voices (and 
others such as genderqueer, non-white, non-western etc.) in AI development, re-
claiming these technologies for collaborative activism, art, engagement and 
social impact.  
Through activating a diverse community of forty-five self-identifying 
women, through four free workshops across Plymouth (KAST80), Bristol (Knowle 
West Media Centre81 ), and Coventry (Random String Festival82), the project set 
out to empower women with a conceptual and technical understanding of 
conversational technologies in order to challenge the status quo of their 
development. The project was developed across April – November 2018 in 
partnership with artist, technologist and researcher Coral Manton. WRAI has also 
been presented at the following public events; ‘Human Bias In Artificial 
Intelligence: Can we fix it?’ at KWMC in Bristol (Aga and Manton, 2018a), ‘Things 
That Talk. AI In Art – A FACT Late Night’ at FACT in Liverpool (Aga and Manton, 
2018b) and ‘Disobedient AI’ at the Random String Festival in Coventry (Aga and 
Manton, 2018c). WRAI has also received funding from Arts Council England to 
continue a series of workshops and exhibitions across the UK in 2019.

3.3.1. Intention 
The intentions of WRAI were focused on generating discourse with 
participants, (rather than with audiences engaged through public presentations 
of work), through conversations by collaboratively doing practice. WRAI creates 
a discourse around stereotyping and bias in current commercial AI 
developments. It differs from the others in that it explicitly grapples with the 
commercial technology development process and its lack of diversity and actively 
engages participants as a form of activism, attempting to empower them to 
challenge the status quo. This desire emerged from observing the complexity of 
the previous prototypes, not the amalgamation of diverse intentions, desires and 
Figure 66: WRAI system diagram (Aga & Manton, 2018)

ideas, but the complexity of the artefacts and their scenarios.  The aim was to 
claim conversational AI with their target users for new forms of creative practice 
which create discourse through conversations with participants, rather than 
creating complex systems played out as public scenarios. Whilst previous 
prototypes engaged a large number of audiences and had big collaborative 
teams of up to twenty people, with up to fifteen participants, WRAI was developed 
in collaboration with one artists / technologist. The ambition was to reduce the 
complexity of the collaboration and the prototype, and instead scale up the 
participation to engaging fifty self-identifying women, through a series of free, 
short and collaborative three-hour workshops.  
The project draws a reference to Haraway’s (1991) ‘A Cyborg Manifesto’ 
and a move beyond the limitations of traditional gender, feminism, and politics 
agendas. It grounds the project ideas in what Renzel (2017) describes as 
cyberfeminism’s groundwork for the ‘concept of the internet being a revolutionary 
tool to overthrow patriarchy, destroy the existing gender binary and achieve 
feminist liberation’. However, WRAI recognises that the Internet (or emergent 
technologies) is not a new neutral space as envisioned by Haraway, where 
women can overthrow the existing social order, but very much embedded and 
reflective of society. Emergent technologies are human creations and therefore, 
as Renzel (2017) stipulates, biased and imbued with the sexist and racist 
assumptions which pervades society.  
WRAI does embrace the intention of cyberfeminism and other forms of 
activist art on the Internet for their potential to reclaim these media as spaces for 
the participation of women-led discourse. It points to Looui and Flanagan’s (2017, 
p182) review of activist art on the Internet where they draw a parallel with the lack 
 
174 
of representation of women in computer science, to a similar lack of ‘women 
artists who are producing theoretically challenging and technologically ‘cutting-
edge’ websites that are also explicitly feminist. This position informs the WRAI 
project to apply not only the Internet, but emergent technologies such as 
conversational systems as tools for women’s resistance through participation.  
The project’s intentions emerge from this approach and simultaneously 
frame its agenda as a direct response to the specific lack of gender diversity83 in 
the development of AI systems, and the use of gender stereotypes and biased 
data-sets in the development of AI voice assistants like Google Assistant, Alexa, 
Siri, Cortana and Bixby. These all use female names, identities, voices (as a 
response to pressure an increasing number now have an option to change the 
gender of the voice to male). Fessler (2017) highlights that gender roles and 
sexism are reinforced through these systems where female assistants are 
portrayed as subservient and assisting, being programmed with flirtatious and 
submissive responses to any verbal sexual harassment by users. By engaging a 
community of self-identifying women, with no previous experience of technology 
development, the ambition was to empower these women to design their own 
conversational system constituted by their own decision around gender identity 
and roles.  This position informs the project to apply emergent technologies such 
as conversational systems as tools for women’s resistance through participation.  
 
 
                                                
83 WIRED magazine conducted a research exercise in 2017 where the found that only 12 percent of 
women contributed work to the three leading machine learning conferences in 2017 (Simonite, 2018).  
According to Google, 21 percent of technical roles are filled by women, however when WIRED reviewed 
the their AI research page out of the listed 641 people working on ‘machine intelligence’, only 10 percent 
were women (ibid). However when delving deeper into these stats to look for diversity beyond gender, 
companies such as Facebook which states that 22 percent of its technical workers are women, there is 
only 1% of Black employees in technical roles (Williams, 2018).

3.3.2. Participatory prototyping 
Participation in WRAI was facilitated through four workshops delivered to 
engage forty-five self-identifying women from across Plymouth, Bristol and 
Coventry. All workshops were free, lasted three hours, and delivered in 
partnership with local arts organisations to their communities. The project 
intentions outlined above shaped and underpinned the creation of a nascent 
community and female-led technology making space for women through the 
workshops. These were reminiscent of DIY and activist-based female knitting 
circles, as described by Segal (2017), Stoller, 2003) and Hermanson (2012). This 
entailed creating a space which was accessible (physically and conceptually), 
non-hierarchical, supportive and confidential. Throughout each workshop this 
ethos was iterated and discussed, whilst each participant was encouraged to 
express their opinions, listen to others and to share any thoughts.  
The workshop provided the participants with a basic understanding, 
knowledge and skills in scripting and making an AI voice assistant in Dialogflow. 
Simultaneously, the act of collaboratively making was a process to facilitate 
talking, sharing and listening. Rooted in a discourse of cyberfeminist and forms 
of online activism, the conversations were framed around highlighting the current 
misrepresentation and lack of diversity in current AI development.  Through this 
process a voice assistant was co-created with a dominant and non-serving 
personality, and with a corpus of speech created with the community of 
participants which they collectively felt was a more representative manifestation 
of a self-identifying woman.  
 
 
 
176 
3.3.3. Scenario, artefact and system design 
The WRAI prototype was focused on creating participatory discourse 
through the act of co-creating, rather than engaging the wider public in discourse. 
Its scenario emerged from the collective world-view of the collaborating self-
identifying women, creating a conversational assistant deployed to a Google 
Home assistant see figure 64) as well as a chatbot on the WRAI website84 (see 
figure 65). The personality and functionality design of these artefacts became 
reflective of the discourse generated. It was dominant and non-serving, and 
ingrained with an amalgamation of interpretations of what a woman should be. 
These were not artefacts design for public consumption or for efficient user 
satisfaction. They emerged as conversational objects and spaces of resistance, 
where the value lies in the collaborative act of shared discourse.  These were 
vessels for the imagining not of what is but of what could be. 
The WRAI Assistant was not publicly available, but used as a 
demonstrative object in the workshops. This was reflective of the project 
objectives with a focus on the participation, not on public engagement. However, 
in response to the workshop participants’ desires to have a public version 
available they could share, showcase and discuss beyond the workshops, we 
made a chatbot version available. This in itself becomes a process of discourse, 
releasing an unfinished, DIY, non-censored growing artefact, that itself was not 
designed for user-satisfaction, but for protest.  
The conversational interface and corpus were created through the 
Dialogflow platform (see figure 67). This is a platform created for the commercial 
development of conversational systems, and not designed for mass-participation 
                                                
84 https://womenreclaimingai.com 
 
177 
or community actions. The process of using this platform and exploiting its 
purpose, became in itself important for the action and discourse generated. Each 
participant was given full editorial access and trust to contribute through the 
adoption of the WRAI community guidelines; 
As a member of a growing community, we ask you to treat others in the 
group with respect and not to delete or change any other people’s entries 
from DialogFlow. We ask that you do not make any entries that could be 
offensive or discriminatory to any vulnerable or minority groups. Your 
entries into DialogFlow will be publicly visible by people using the Chatbot 
on the website so take care with the words you choose. Any words that 
are not your own and entered into Dialogflow needs to be referenced with 
the author in brackets. 
 
The conversational corpus generated through Dialogflow, and which drove 
the conversations with the WRAI system, was reflective of the participants and 
ranged from advice on ‘how to be a feminist’ and ‘how to raise a daughter’, to 
feminist jokes and inspirational speech. However, the content of the 
conversations with the WRAI chatbot, or the wider public interactions with it, was 
Figure 67: Dialogflow the conversational platform used for the WRAI workshops (Aga and 
Manton, 2018) 
 
178 
not important here. It was the engagement with the discourse around the 
stereotyping of women and lack of diversity and participation in the development 
of conversational AI systems that was central, and which drove the overall 
manifestation of the WRAI scenario, artefact and engagement. 
 
3.3.4. Observations and evaluation of practice 
The participation in the workshops and the discourse generated through 
these was here the measurement of impact. It was explicitly concerned with 
actively engaging and upskilling self-identifying women as a form of activism, 
attempting to empower them to challenge the status quo. It drew a reference to 
participatory design as an act of empowerment and democratisation founded on 
a principle of creating legitimate participation for all stakeholders during periods 
of technological change (Malpass 2016; DiSalvo, 2012). This process embraced 
Schuler and Namioka’s (1993) proposition as a process of engaging participants’ 
imagination rather than seeing them as mere respondents or as agents to 
observe and from whom to generate data.  
By engaging a community of self-identifying women, with no previous 
experience of technology development, through the design of a workshop space 
that was accessible, (physically and conceptually), non-hierarchical, supportive 
and confidential, it gained their trust and participation. The design of the space 
was an essential part of the discourse, modelled as a nascent community and 
female-led technology making space (for self-identifying women) reminiscent of 
DIY and activist based female knitting circles. Throughout each workshop this 
ethos was iterated and discussed, whilst each participant was encouraged to 
express their opinion, listen to others and to share any thoughts. Through the 
 
179 
workshops, the women were given a hands-on opportunity to design their own 
conversational system constituted by their own views around gender identity and 
roles, embedding them in the discourse of the existing bias, lack of diversity, and 
stereotyping in current commercial AI developments.  
Through this community space and the act of providing access to the tools 
and understanding of AI development, the participants were given some basic 
tools for collective resistance. This act nurtured a conversational discourse within 
the framework for the workshop but also beyond. Each participant was 
encouraged to share (online and offline) these conversations and the WRAI voice 
assistant itself (accessible from the WRAI website). Each participant had access 
to the development platform post-workshop, and most continued to add to the 
conversational corpus.  
 
3.3.5. Summary of learning and new knowledge  
Through this process WRAI collectively reclaimed the AI technologies (and 
related commercial development processes) it was critiquing, as a medium for 
women’s resistance through collective participation. By doing so if follows 
Consalvo’s (2002, p. 109) call to action; ‘women must be part of this future, not 
by simply advocating for more women to engage in using technology, but by 
becoming more critically aware of the perils as well as promises that new 
technologies offer.’ It was a call to social action, through solidarity, learning, 
freedom, vision, and resistance, to empower women to ‘code’; a discourse which 
demands a more desirable and representational technologically mediated future.   
WRAI delivered against the following objectives of this practice-based 
research inquiry: 
 
180 
• Empower women as participants to challenge, discuss and 
participate in technology development: 
WRAI prioritised the engagement of self-identifying women in hands-on 
technology development and design to generate dialogue and empower 
them to challenge the lack of diversity and presence of stereotyping within 
conversational AI developments. 
• Claim emergent conversational AI technologies 
TIWWA claimed emergent conversational AI technologies with their target 
users for new forms of creative practice, which had social debate as a 
fundamental goal and desired outcome, to disrupt the commercial 
development of unethical and exclusive AI systems. 
• Evidencing the bias and stereotyping in conversational AI 
technologies:  
WRAI evidenced the presence of bias and stereotyping in conversational 
AI technologies, a factor which propagates their perlocutionary effect. 
• Creating actual and traceable participation in discourse: 
The participation of self-identifying women in the WRAI workshops was in 
itself the measure of impact and the documentation engagement with 
discourse. This was further extended to evidencing actual and traceable 
participation through the interaction and conversational data generated 
through the system’s conversational interface. This was the third 
documentation of the potential of a prototyping practice, with a 
participatory method, to encourage deeper discourse and engagement.  
 
The observations from WRAI which informed the following Infinite Guide 
prototype are: 
• Design strategy: 
Specifically apply a design strategy that exploits the relationality of 
conversational systems through the design of system attributes; 
personality and affect. 
• Context and location of participants: 
Focus on designing this with young people but for the wider public to widen 
the engagement with the discourse put forward. 
 
181 
• Creating actual and traceable participation in discourse: 
Further test the impact of a discursive design approach extended with a 
participatory method and consider the aspect of actual and traceable 
participation 
through 
the 
application 
of 
conversational 
systems 
themselves as mechanism to engage people in dialogue.  
• Empower participants to challenge, discuss and participate in 
technology development: 
Focus on empowering people to challenge, discuss and participate in 
technology development by creating opportunities for hands-on 
technology development and design. Also focus on extending this 
dialogue with the wider public to widen impact of the prototype. 
• Claim emergent conversational AI technologies 
Claim emergent conversational AI technologies with their target users for 
new forms of creative practice, which has social debate as a fundamental 
goal and desired outcome, to disrupt the commercial development of 
unethical and exclusive AI systems. 
• Synthesise 
and 
substantiate 
overall 
claims 
from 
previous 
prototypes: 
Test and synthesises the findings from the three previous prototypes to 
substantiate the overall perlocutionary effect of conversational AI system. 
Further evidence the impact of a discursive design strategy to activate 
people to challenge the commercial development of conversational AI 
systems and re-imagining more desirable future realities being with 
relational things that talk.

3.4. Prototype 04: The Infinite Guide 
 
 
Figure 68: The Infinite Guide Identity (Aga et al., 2018b) 
 
          The Infinite Guide (Aga et al., 2018) synthesises the findings from the three 
previous prototypes to substantiate the overall perlocutionary effect of 
conversational AI system. It consisted of three online chatbots, and physical 
installation with a voice interface and an audio-visual projection (see figures 70 - 
76). The Infinite Guide system (see figure 69) was constructed through the same 
technologies used in the previous prototypes; Dialogflow for the conversational 
interfaces (chatbots and voice interface), Node Red for the system processing 
and networking, and IBM Watson for analysing sentiments in the conversational 
data generated. However, this system also incorporated the LSTM Recurrent 
Neural Net to generate text responses for users. Overall the Infinite Guide system 
was designed to incorporate all processes of user engagement and discourse, 
intentionally creating a fully technology-led experience of the systems the 
discourse was attempting to critique. 
 
183 
 
The Infinite Guide was developed in collaboration with a group of young 
people through Fact85 and KARST86, the i-DAT Collective, InterCity, Story 
Juice87, University of Plymouth’s Digital Media Design programme88 and the 
student start-up Crumb Design89. The project engaged people in a narrative and 
speculative experience which took place online and physically, through the 
exhibition and talks at KARST the 1st – 9th September 2018. The project, funded 
by the Arts Council England, engaged 15 young people as participants, 4 young

people as collaborators, 78 young people in participatory talks, and an audience 
of 1466 (1215 online). The project was presented at the ‘Disobedient AI’ panel at 
The Random String Festival (2018) in Coventry, the ‘Human Bias In Artificial 
Intelligence’ (2018) at KWMC in Bristol and the ‘AI In Art – A FACT Late Night’ at 
FACT in Liverpool (2018). 
 
3.4.1. Intention 
The Infinite Guide emerged at the confluence of the findings from the 
previous iterative prototypes and participatory processes; peoples’ susceptibility 
to human-like systems and these systems’ authority, relationality and 
persuasiveness, in spite of their lack of transparency, imbued bias and hybrid 
intentions. The intention was to further explore the perlocutionary effect of 
conversational systems; their relationality, persuasiveness, hybrid intentions and 
bias, and to nurture deeper engagement through participation with discourse.  
The relationality, persuasiveness, bias and hybrid intentions of The Infinite 
Guide was intentionally constructed through the design of its systems functions; 
personality design, personalisation, conversational ability and affective functions. 
The intention was to propagate the perlocutionary effect of conversational 
systems to affect the thoughts, beliefs and actions of people interacting with it, 
amplified through the use of online and physical interfaces. In so doing 
substantiate the findings from the three previous prototypes in documenting the 
overall perlocutionary effect of conversational AI systems. 
The work was grounded in the proposition that as the complexity and 
power of intelligent systems expand beyond human comprehension, faith is 
necessarily reintroduced. This positions the computational system as an 
 
185 
ideological and mythic incarnation of an emergent artificial spiritual guide, a guide 
residing in ‘cathedrals of computation’ (Bogost, 2015), conjured through scientific 
and technological progress, whom we believe leads to our immortality. A quest, 
driven by a pursuit for transcendence and salvation where we, according to 
Gollner (2013, p. 35-36), take for granted that; ‘suffering can be eliminated, that 
poverty will ultimately be eradicated, that we should never be sick again, that 
science will soon make everybody never die’. A technological future forged in the 
naïve, biased and diversity-challenged furnace of Silicon Valley if left 
unchallenged.  
The intentions of the Infinite Guide project were rooted in this position, 
speculating around the current and near future influence of our increasingly 
symbiotic relationship with intelligent systems, guiding our thoughts, actions and 
behaviour, and their juxtaposition with their emergence as artificial spiritual 
guides. It set out to unravel the complexities of these systems, revealing and 
questioning their bias and hybrid intentions. Ultimately the ambition of The Infinite 
Guide was to activate people to challenge the commercial development of 
conversational AI systems and re-imagining more desirable future realities being 
with relational things that talk.  
Through appropriating conversational AI systems with people the ambition 
was to generate a speculative discourse, as a counter-narrative about what it will 
mean to be human, individually and collectively, in a near future increasingly living 
with and through AI systems. In so doing it will invite participants and audiences 
to reflect on their desired future relationship with these technologies and the 
inherent pursuit of immortality through technological innovation.  
 
186 
The project extended TIWWA and Emoti-OS’s application of a design 
strategy that exploits people’s reliance on and emergent relationship with AI 
powered conversational systems, with simulated affect, personality and 
intelligence. At the same time, it intended to expanded the discourse around the 
inherent bias and hybrid intentions of AI systems explored in WRAI. These 
previous prototypes manifested as a confluence of the ideas and desires arising 
from participants and collaborators, shaped within pre-defined conceptual 
frameworks emerging from the theoretical exploration of this thesis. These were 
responsive and shaped by their context (place, space, people and systems). The 
primary purpose of their related scenarios and artefacts was to communicate 
ideas and trigger conversations, as ‘tools for thinking’ (Tharp and Tharp, 2019). 
Here the importance was on participation itself, and the narrative context and 
public presentation of the artefact itself secondary.  
The Infinite Guide, rooted in the learning from these previous iterations, 
was driven by an intention to test if its wider impact and engagement could be 
increased by creating a prototype, designing specifically for a public presentation 
and discourse, with a more provocative near future narrative. A narrative 
delivered and extended through the conversational systems it was critiquing. 
Referencing the practice of design fiction (Bleecker 2009; Grand & Wiedmer 
2010; Sterling, 2009) it intended to place a strong emphasis on technological 
futures and the use of a fictional scenario, but also, as in the previous iterative 
prototypes, integrated working systems and real-time data to trigger individual 
and intimate interactions with these systems.  
The Infinite Guide appropriated conversational and AI powered 
technologies that exist today to extrapolate interactive and data-driven scenarios 
 
187 
of what they, and the human consequence of these, could be in the near future. 
By doing so it aimed to test the impact of claiming conversational AI technologies 
with their target users for new forms of creative practice, which has social debate 
as a fundamental goal and desired outcome, to disrupt the commercial 
development of unethical and exclusive AI systems. 
 
3.4.2. Participatory prototyping 
Conceptually framed by the intentions outlined above, the prototyping 
process differed from the previous iterations. The Infinite Guide intended to bring 
the concerns and learning from these iterative prototypes together through 
designing a near future fictional narrative, presented in the public realm and 
designed, delivered and evaluated through technological systems it was 
critiquing. The requirement to deliver this informed the need for authorship of the 
speculative narrative an overall experience design. Whereas the development 
and design of TIWWA and Emoti-OS’s scenarios and the artefacts emerged 
through a collaborative process, responsive to and shaped by the people taking 
part, The Infinite Guide became responsive to and shaped by these intentions 
instead of an amalgamation of the intentions of participants. Participation and 
collaboration were still central to the process, and to the overall intended impact 
and engagement with the discourse. The participatory process was formed 
through a partnership with FACT Learning, the outreach programme at KARST, 
Plymouth University’s Digital Media Design programme and the already 
established partnership with Plymouth School of Creative Arts. It was designed 
to engage young people as participants (aged twelve to twenty-five) and the wider 
public as the audience. 
 
188 
The participatory prototyping process started with a two-day long 
workshop at FACT, with a group of 15 young people. They were given the overall 
fictional scenario of The Infinite Guide which was set in a near future where AI 
systems have become intimate and prophesying intermediaries, fuelled by 
personal data and promises of digital transcendence from mortality. The 
workshop was driven by the intention to engage participants in discourse, where 
discussions, theorising and prototyping were all manifestations of participation in 
this discourse.  This was delivered through a mix of future gazing, hands on 
experimentation and paper prototyping, followed by a series of collaborative 
sessions where the group developed different prototypes responsive to the 
fictional narrative of The Infinite Guide. This was also an iterative process, going 
from paper prototypes to simple working artefacts. This was simultaneously a 
process to test the engagement with The Infinite Guide’s scenario and artefacts. 
It enabled the participants with basic skills and knowledge to unravel the 
complexity of conversational AI technologies as well as their commercial 
development methods, and a conversational space to express, discuss and 
imagine a more desirable future living with AI systems. 
Parallel to the participatory process set up with FACT Learning, a process 
of collaboration was initiated through the i-DAT Collective with Intercity, Story 
Juice and the student design group Crumb from Plymouth University’s Digital 
Media Design programme. Whilst the speculative narrative of The Infinite Guide 
was framed, the user’s experiential journey was shaped through a collaborative 
process with these partners. The group of five young people were mentored 
through this process, but treated as equal collaborators and paid for their time. 
To direct the integrity of the project, enable the design and build of the project 
aspects and to ensure each collaborators area of expertise and interest was 
 
189 
visible and recognised, the collaborative process was carefully facilitated and 
produced. This took place through physical workshops and development 
sessions, communication through a Slack channel (online communication and 
collaborative working platform), regular updates from all participants and 
collective decision making.  
 
3.4.3. Scenario, artefact and system design 
The project set out a provocation around an artificially mediated future 
driven by techno-dreams and spiritual yearnings for supernatural redemption. It 
conjured a near future where AI systems have become intimate and prophesying 
intermediaries. With their anticipatory whispers fuelled by personal data, they 
predicted your needs, swayed your actions, and summoned faith in the 
technological through promises of digital transcendence from mortality. Created 
through a narrative starting off by asking people ‘Do you want to live forever?’, it 
took the user through a parallel journey which could be experienced online at The 
Infinite Guide website90 and / or physically, at the KARST gallery in Plymouth. 
Participants’ first point of contact with the Infinite Guide was through a ‘personal 
immortality test’ (see figure 70) consisting of seven questions around a person’s 
willingness to augment their body and reach for digital immortality.  
The test itself was a central reference to the seminal work by 
transhumanist91 FM 2030 (1989) ‘Are You Transhuman?’ which offers a range of 
                                                
90 www.infinite.guide 
91 The use of the term transhuman refers to Transhumanism described by More and Vita-More’s (2013, p.4) 
in their publication ‘The Transhumanist Reader: Classical and Contemporary Essays on the Science, 
Technology, and Philosophy of the Human Future’ as a ‘life philosophy’ and an ‘intellectual and cultural 
movement’, which seeks to improve the human body and human condition by means of science and 
technology. This is a pursuit further described by More (2011) to accelerate the ‘evolution of intelligent life 
beyond its currently human form and human limitations’. A movement supported by advocates who are 
widely recognised and respected scientists and academicians such as Ray Kurzweil (renown inventor of 
numerous AI technologies and author of key publications on AI), Kevin Warwick (professor of cybernetics at 
Reading University) and  Marvin Minsky (former co-founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's 
 
190 
personal tests to determine one’s readiness for becoming transhuman. Those 
who passed the test, by showing a ‘readiness’ towards digital immortality, were 
invited to have an audience with The Infinite Guide online, or in person at KARST 
Gallery. Those who failed were told “Sorry, your score means you are not deemed 
immortality ready. Your lack of faith in the world’s enlightened technology 
evangelists forging our eternal futures means you cannot proceed to meet The 
Infinite Guide”. 
Those that got through to meet The Infinite Guide online were given a 
secret link to the Infinite Guide chatbot interface (see figure 71) and an 
opportunity to ask a question about their future. This act was a reference to 
spiritual guidance, offered through meetings with mediums, fortune tellers and 
religious leaders, and simultaneously, the act of looking for answers through 
online services. After the user asked their question they were given access to the 
‘Inner Sanctum of all Knowledge’ (see figure 71), which revealed not only the 
                                                
AI laboratory, and author of several texts concerning AI and philosophy). However, a movement which also 
is criticised for its instrumentalist view of humans nature. A view based on a largely white, western and male 
perspective, and which lacks consideration to its threat to equality and morality itself (Doede 2009; 
Fukuyama 2004; Habermas, 2003).

The physical encounter with the Infinite Guide was conducted through a 
confessional box (see figure 73 and 74), mirrored on the inside with a hacked 
Google Assistant.  The mirror room within the box had a dual function as a 
conceptual link to the idea of facing and experiencing infinity, and a direct 
reference to the art work ‘Room No. 2’ by Lucas Samara (1966)92. Within this 
space, audiences were greeted by The Infinite Guide voice interface, through a 
modified Google Assistant, and invited to ask a question about their future. After 
the system responded it invited the audience into the Inner Sanctum, represented 
physically in the KARST main gallery space as an audio-visual installation (see 
figure 75 and 76).  
                                                
92 Lucas Samara (1966) installation ‘Room No. 2’ was one of the earliest installation artworks that 
encouraged viewers to enter and experience rather than passively view. This is central to what The Infinite 
Guide is trying to do; it is inviting audiences into the artwork and simultaneously to experience and actively 
take part within the discourse the art work is trying to generate.

This space was designed to draw a reference from spaces of religious 
worship, welcoming audiences through the preaching of The Infinite Guide, 
represented as a male voice with an American accent. The content of the sermon 
was a real-time reading of all users’ questions and the Infinite Guide’s answers 
from online and physical interactions. The sound booming from above was 
synchronised to the wall projections displaying all user questions and response 
in real-time. The red light projected from above indicated the presence and 
speech of the Infinite guide, and a direct reference to the AI ‘HAL 900’ in Stanley 
Kubrick’s ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’. The space itself was created as a space for 
contemplation of the discourse. 
The AI system (LSTM Recurrent Neural Net) powering the Infinite Guide 
was trained with an intentionally biased and non-diverse corpus of data 
aggregated from a collection of writings from luminaries of the transhumanist

movement who are largely western, white and male, such as FM-2030, Anders 
Sandberg, Ray Kurzweil, Zoltan Istvan, Vernor Vinge, Max More, David Levy, 
R.U. Sirius, Aubrey de Grey, and Michael Rae. Deliberately non-diverse and non-
representative, the AI generated its own poetic responses, based on its training 
data, often unexpected, indecipherable and seeped with terminology learnt from 
its transhumanist training data. Through its authoritative utterances, it guided its 
chosen users towards a biased and exclusive utopian ideal of digital immortality.  
At the end of The Infinite Guide’s user journey, an additional 
conversational strand was inserted, facilitated by the systems itself through a 
‘Thoughts’ chatbot. It invited audiences (through cards handed out (see figure 77) 
and a projection within the Inner Sanctum gallery space), into another 
conversation with its chatbot through the promise of the system ‘telling them how 
they feel’ about AI and technological salvation in itself. (See Appendix VIII: 
‘Conversational structure the Infinite Guide - Thoughts’ for a systematic overview 
of the process). Audiences that did engage with this conversation, got a system 
evaluation at the end of the conversation that told them how they ‘felt’. This in 
itself was a commentary on the failure of audience satisfaction surveys to capture 
Figure 77: The Infinite Guide audiences engagement cards (Aga, et al., 2018b) 
 
196 
people’s real feelings, as well as the failure of any AI technology to truly 
understand their users. 
 
 
3.4.4. Observations and evaluation of practice 
The Infinite Guide functioned as a confluence of the learning and 
knowledge from the previous prototypes, to inform, test and iterate the central 
inquiry of this thesis, the perlocutionary effect. At the same time extend a 
discursive design approach through activating an often passive audience and 
engage them in follow up dialogue, as a form of design activism. The Infinite 
Guide appropriated conversational and AI powered technologies that exist today 
to extrapolate interactive and data-driven scenarios of what they, and the human 
consequence of these, could be in the near future. By doing so it tested the ability 
of the systems themselves to deliver, provoke and evaluate the impact of the 
discourse generated. It positioned and designed the participatory method 
differently than in TIWWA and Emoti-OS. Here, the conceptual framework as well 
as the related scenario and artefacts was designed before the participatory 
process was initiated. This was a response to the need for authorship of the 
speculative narrative an overall experience design, to bring the concerns and 
learning from these iterative prototypes together, and to test the ability of the 
conversational AI System itself to deliver and evaluate the engagement with its 
discourse. Collaboration was still central to this process. Developed with the 
project partners it shaped the user’s experiential journey and development of the 
scenario and artefacts. This process included the mentoring of four young people 
whom where included as equal collaborators and paid for their time. This enabled 
 
197 
a process where the young collaborators were upskilled and engaged deeper 
with the development processes of conversational AI systems. 
The participatory method engaged fifteen young people (aged twelve to 
twenty-five) facilitated by FACT Learning. This process was also designed to 
engage participants in the project’s discourse, where discussions, theorising and 
prototyping were all manifestations of their participation. Through creation a 
nascent community and young people-led technology making space, the 
participants were given both a contextual understanding of the issues within AI 
development, as well as the skills to develop a conversational AI system. The act 
of discussing and making was a process to facilitate engagement with the 
project’s discourse. Through this engagement, the participants led the creation of 
their own scenario and artefacts. Though this was framed by the discourse of The 
Infinite Guide, it emerged with its own narrative, and was presented as prototype 
scenarios at a public event at FACT. By giving the young people full authorship 
and ownership without the constrains of an overarching agenda, it enabled a 
deeper engagement with the discourse. Neil Winterburn, Learning Technologist 
at FACT, summarised the learning form these parapatry workshops based on a 
focus group with the young people taking part (see Appendix XI: The Infinite 
Guide YP Participant Feedback for a full summary):  
The young people developed a range of valuable communication skills, 
technical skills. They were introduced to voice computer interaction 
through AI chatbots and Text Adventures as artistic forms and this gave 
them a framework to think about and discuss the role of AI in our society, 
representation and diversity in AI from a completely different perspective. 
The young people were able to write chatbot scripts that critiqued and 
played with the expectations we bring to a conversation with a chatbot. 
Writing these scripts gave them a voice to talk about their relationship with 
technology and to challenge the vision that adults in the tech industry 
present for our future relationship with AI. 
 
 
198 
The wider public engagement with The Infinite Guide was facilitated by the 
AI system itself. From the first interactions online with the chatbot, through to the 
arrival at the Inner Sanctum, (in the gallery or online), the speculative narrative 
created different levels of engagement and interactions. Of the 1466 audiences 
which interacted with the work, 1215 did so online, and out of these 331 went 
through to the final stage of ‘meeting’ the Infinite Guide online and 120 people did 
so through visiting the Infinite Guide in the mirror box in the KARST gallery. 
Through the questions asked by audiences and the responses given by The 
Infinite Guide, an emergent and poetic narrative was constructed.  Whereas 
users expected their quest for answers to be fulfilled, the system instead 
responded with its own obsessive and inward-looking agenda. Disregarding the 
faith placed on its ability to tell the future, the system ignored their calls for 
answers. As a manifestation of the incompatibility of human and machine, the 
poetics emerged through the humanity rooted in the audience’s desires for 
reassurance about their future, and the system’s disregard for humanity 
(illustrated in figure 78) (see Appendix IX: ‘The Infinite Guide Conversational 
Data’ for a full list of  conversations data from interactions with audiences).

“what is the meaning of life? ”

“Can you be privy to the truth of existence and still find

Figure 78: Audience questions to The Infinite Guide 
 
199 
Of the audience members which came to the gallery exhibition, 71 people 
interacted with the additional ‘Thoughts’ chatbot, which gathered their opinions 
about their experience and relationship to future AI technologies. In return this 
system gave audiences an analysis of how the system thought they ‘felt’ (see 
Appendix X: ‘The Infinite Guide ‘Thoughts’ Chatbot Conversational Data’ for the 
data from this conversation). The interest was not in the data itself, but a 
performative act where people willingly engaged with the system to tell them how 
they felt, and therefore with the discourse in itself. By offering ‘real’ interaction, 
(opposed to artefacts viewed at a distance), with and through conversational AI 
systems, The Infinite Guide attempted to trigger the perlocutionary effect 
generated by and our relationship with conversational systems this research as 
practice inquiry is critiquing. At the same time extend a discursive design 
approach through activating an often passive audience and engage them in 
follow up dialogue (Kerspern, 2015). 
Compared to TIWWA and Emoti-OS, The Infinite Guide asked for a 
deeper, more demanding and intimate interaction with its scenario and artefacts. 
It presented a narrative journey across its different online and physical interfaces. 
Through designing this layered interaction, audience was enticed, persuaded and 
forced to carry on in return for the reward of revealing their desires and being 
included in the final experience. This was in itself a reflection of the relationship 
between users and many AI powered services and products.  
Whereas TIWWA and its discourse was somewhat hidden under its 
abstract manifestation, it did offer the audience instant user gratification through 
its tactile and responsive interactions. Similarly, Emoti-OS did not demand 
deeper levels of engagement from the users. This instead emerged subtly as a 
 
200 
property designing through its relationality.  The Infinite Guide’s layered narrative 
and multiple technology interfaces did not offer such instant gratification or subtle 
engagement. Instead it demanded audiences to persist and continue to engage 
to receive their reward. A request which arguably reduced the number of people 
which actually engaged with the whole experience, however those who did, did 
enter into a deeper dialogue with the system, and therefor in its discourse. A 
dialogue which questioned the faith we place in these systems, and the answers 
that we seek from this silicon based ‘other’, forged in a speculative future of 
pervasive and ubiquitous integration with relational things. 
The relationality, persuasiveness, bias and hybrid intentions of The Infinite 
Guide was intentionally constructed through the design of its systems functions; 
personality design, personalisation, conversational ability and affective functions. 
The strategy of applying the perlocutionary effect of conversational systems as 
an intentional design paradigm, was more subtle in its manifestation in this 
prototype compared to the emotive personality design of Emoti-OS or the 
embodied anthropomorphic artefacts of TIWWA. However, it intentionally 
attempted to assert its influence, authority and persuasiveness through its 
interactions with people, amplified through the use of online and physical 
interfaces.  
By displaying behaviours that made people interacting feel as though they 
were dealing with a sentient ‘other’ that could tell them their future desires, The 
Infinite Guide evoked emotive expectations and faith in its’ ability to provide the 
answers people where seeking. It also evidenced the system’s ability to persuade 
users to persist to interact trough the offer of telling them ‘how they felt’ and 
provide them with answers to their desires. Its persuasiveness and authority 
 
201 
appeared to go unquestioned, until the system revealed its’ biased and narrow 
world-view, limited by the system’s inability to demonstrate true understanding, 
empathy and wisdom.  In so doing inviting people to reflect on a near future living 
relational things, and the faith they place in ‘them’. 
 
3.4.1. Summary of learning and new knowledge  
 
 
The Infinite Guide has iterated, substantiated and synthesised the findings 
from 
the 
three 
previous 
prototypes, 
demonstrating 
the 
overall 
perlocutionary effect of conversational AI system. By applying a design strategy 
that exploit these systems relationality, persuasiveness, hybrid intentions and 
bias, and which deploys conversational systems as conveyors of discourse, it has 
nurtured deeper engagement through participation with discourse. In so doing it 
will invite participants and audiences to reflect on their desired future relationship 
with these technologies and the inherent pursuit of immortality through 
technological innovation. 
The Infinite Guide delivered against the following objectives of this 
practice-based research inquiry: 
• Design strategy: 
The Infinite Guide applied a design strategy that exploited the relationality, 
persuasiveness, bias and hybrid intentions of conversational systems, 
evidencing the presence of a perlocutionary effect and people’s 
susceptibility to it. 
• Context of participants: 
This prototype was designed with young people but for the wider public to 
widen the engagement with its discourse.  
• Creating actual and traceable participation in discourse: 
 
202 
It tested the impact of a discursive design approach extended with a 
participatory method. It built on the learning from Emot-OS in applying a 
conversational systems itself as a mechanisms to engage and evidence 
participation and dialogue.  
• Empower participants to challenge, discuss and participate in 
technology development: 
Through creating opportunities for hands-on technology development and 
design the Infinite Guide empowered the young people taking part to 
challenge, discuss and participate in technology development. It 
furthermore extending this dialogue with the wider public to widen impact 
of the prototype. 
• Claim emergent conversational AI technologies 
This prototype claimed emergent conversational AI technologies with their 
target users for new forms of creative practice, which had social debate as 
a fundamental goal and desired outcome. By educating participants and 
challenging audiences, it created skills, knowledge and dialogue which 
challenge the commercial development of unethical and exclusive AI 
systems. 
• Synthesise 
and 
substantiate 
overall 
claims 
from 
previous 
prototypes: 
Overall the Infinite Guide has tested and synthesised the findings from the 
three previous prototypes, substantiating the overall perlocutionary effect 
of conversational AI system. In so doing it has evidenced the impact of a 
discursive design strategy to activate people to challenge the commercial 
development of conversational AI systems and re-imagining more 
desirable future realities being with relational things that talk. 
 
 
 
 
 
203 
3.5. The appropriation of relational things that 
talk as a discursive design strategy 
 
The hypothesis of the perlocutionary effect of conversational systems has 
framed this central prototyping practice manifesting as the four discursive 
prototypes; TIWWA, Emoti-OS, WRAI and The Infinite Guide. Developed through 
a participatory method, these prototypes have demonstrated and synthesised the 
factors that constitute and propagate this effect. They have also demonstrated 
their role as instruments actively engaging participants in a counter-narrative as 
a form of activism. This practice-based research has co-created a discourse with 
people rather than just for people. It has engaged a range of collaborators; 
professionals (designers, technology developers, artists and researchers) and 
participants (particularly young people and women). By doing so it has tried to 
include more people whose voices are currently underrepresented or lacking 
within technology development. It has demonstrated that participation in the 
design of a discourse, where the people taken part are given real authorship in a 
democratic and inclusive design space, deepen their engagement with the 
proposed discourse. 
Through the method of participation, the people that took part were 
encouraged to take ownership of the discourse and make it relevant to their 
experiences and realities. There was a distinct threshold of engagement, ranging 
from superficial to deeper intellectual and emotional, rooted in the relevance and 
ownership a participant felt in relation to the discourse. Also, the type and 
temporality of interactions created affected the level of engagement of the 
audience. A transient audience that only had short or single interactions with a 
 
204 
scenario and artefacts, was less perceptible to its discourse.  It became clear that 
an audience member who had not been involved in the design of the discourse 
was less likely to invest deeper into engaging with the scenario and related 
artefacts. The effectiveness of engaging people in a discursive discourse was 
here found to be directly related to the ability of connecting to their realities, world-
views, concerns and desires. A process achieved through engaging people as 
co-creators and participants in the design of a relevant near future realties. 
By appropriating the conversational systems (and their design 
frameworks) the practice was critiquing, as a material and method of production, 
it provided the participants with a better understanding of these technologies and 
their design. At the same time this was a mechanism to reveal their inherent their 
bias, influence and power as well as their errors and limitations.  By embedding 
relational things that talk with discourse it elicited engagement with and through 
the systems being critiqued. This engagement was observed and evaluated 
through the system itself, and therefore generated conversational data. However, 
the intention was not to process this data or to elicit meaning from it, rather it was 
explicitly concerned with using the systems as instruments for actively engaging 
participants in a counter-narrative as a form of design activism. This process 
embraced Schuler and Namioka’s (1993) proposition of engaging participants’ 
imagination rather than mere respondents from whom to generate data.  
Within this practice, participation has been the measurement of impact and 
what the focus has been on. In so doing, this inquiry has responded to the second 
research question of this practice-based inquiry demonstrating the value and 
impact of appropriation relational things that talk as a discursive design strategy, 
extended with a participatory method, for new forms of cultural expression and 
 
205 
social action, which activate people to challenge the development of AI systems 
and related services. 
 
 
3.6. The perlocutionary effect as a critical 
design paradigm 
Through the theoretical foundation in chapter two and prototyping practice 
described above has demonstrated, synthesised and evidenced the 
perlocutionary 
effect 
of 
conversational 
systems; 
their 
relationality, 
persuasiveness, authority, hybrid intentions. In so doing it has responded to the 
first research question of this inquiry; how do conversational AI systems, 
relational things that talk, influence the subjective reality and related thoughts, 
behaviours and actions of their users. 
This inquiry has demonstrated the paradigm shift which is taking place in 
human-computer interaction and the emergence of relational things. The 
observations emerging from this activity reaffirms, as proposed by Fogg and 
Nass, 1997a; Fogg and Nass, 1997b; Nass, Moon, et al. 1997; Kiesler and 
Sproull 1997; Reeves and Nass 1999; Turkle, 1995, 2007b, that the simulation of 
human-like qualities in artefacts trigger users to apply their understanding of 
social relationships to their interactions with artificial systems. This was, as Turkle 
(2007b) proposed and evidenced through the prototyping practice outlined in this 
chapter, not based on their intelligence, or reciprocal pleasure in relating, but 
rather in their ability to push our Darwinian buttons. The built-in personality and 
behaviour cues in the prototypes outlined here were enough to elicit the audience 
to anthropomorphise these systems. 
 
206 
Even when the embodiment of the conversational systems demonstrated 
through the discursive prototypes outlined in this chapter was abstracted and 
metaphoric these still appeared to become what Turkle (2007b) describes as 
evocative objects. The display of nonverbal behaviours influenced people’s 
engagement and likeability of an agent, as proposed by McTear et al. (2016). 
However, when audiences entered into dialogue with these systems they began 
questioning and testing its ‘human-like’ narrative qualities. With language 
introduced as an interface people’s expectations of the systems appeared to 
increase, whilst the projection of ‘imagined’ human-like qualities decreased. Only 
when the system was able to convince a ‘user’ to again suspend their disbelief, 
did the act of anthropomorphising the system continue.  
 
People are naturally inclined to humanise things unless they are convinced 
otherwise. A tendency which is exploited by corporations designing relational 
things to better integrate their systems into our life. Depending on the relationality 
and persuasiveness of these artificial systems, people quickly assimilate them 
into their social world, and place little consideration on their inherent bias, hybrid 
intentions and overall influence. This calls for a revaluation of the commercial 
design and deployment of conversational systems, taking into account the 
perlocutionary effect on their users. A call which demands for more participatory 
and ethical design frameworks through activating and empowering people (users) 
to challenge the authority, power and lack of (real) inclusion of users in the 
commercial design of AI systems. A process which is here outlined, and 
evidenced through the practice described in this chapter, as a proposition of 
‘relational things that talk’ as a discursive design strategy, extended through a 
participatory method and delivered through the conversational AI systems it is 
 
207 
critiquing. To achieve the goal of triggering critical thinking and participation in 
the design of future human-machine relationships, and seed any potential social 
action, one must engage their future users. By claiming emergent AI technologies 
for a design discourse and social action, we can start to re-imagine more 
desirable future realities being with relational things.  
The way we relate to AI systems that ‘talk, feel and care’ and the way they 
relate to us, (as well as what that does to us) as humans, should be the starting 
point for designing systems capable of human-like behaviour and embodiment. 
The human susceptibility to systems optimised through the attribution of natural 
language communication, personality, affect and embodied functions is 
evidenced both through the practice outlined in chapter three, as well as through 
the commercial examples and theoretical grounding outlined in chapter two. 
These functionalities and characteristics construct the relationality and 
persuasiveness of conversational systems, informing the potency of their 
perlocutionary effect on their users. However, it is the hybrid intentions and bias 
embedded within these systems, compounded by a user’s susceptibility, that 
propagates the valence (the positive, neutral or negative) of this effect.  
As demonstrated through the practice outlined here, technological 
artefacts are neither passive nor mute, but active and mediating things with which 
we are in the process of merging in significant ways (Haraway 1991; Ihde 1990; 
Verbeek, 2005, 2006a, 2008b, 2011; Latour 1993; Hayles 1999). Hybrid 
intentions, as outlined in chapter two, constructed from the (declared and 
undeclared) intentions of the manufacturers, designers and the users, are 
embedded within the design, functionalities and goals of conversational systems. 
These intentions direct the system’ objectives and therefore how they influence 
 
208 
a user. Simultaneously, the data used to train these systems reflects biases from 
the conditions within which it has been collected the world views of those coding 
the systems and also from people using these systems. If these systems are 
being trained on user data they may give some groups preference over others 
based on gender, race, sexuality, postcode and so on (Anderson and Anderson, 
2007; Ball, 2018; Madhu, 2018; Knight, 2017a, 2017b; O’Neil, 2017). 
Due to the complexity of conversational AI systems, current patent rights, 
commercialisation and the value of data mining, many intentions of their 
manufacturers and the use of data are hidden within the systems themselves, 
and difficult to decipher and predict unless clearly stated by their manufacturers. 
These corporate intentions also inform these systems’ technology platforms, 
functionality and interface designs, how users’ data is harvested and used, as 
well as the application (or lack of) ethical frameworks. Their designers may also 
encode their own intentions within the construction of the systems; to increase 
user satisfaction and engagement, or control user interaction and objectives. At 
the same time, their users will also have their own intentions in using the system 
as well as bringing their own subjective context, intentionality and world view. 
This confluence of factors contributes to a conversational system’s ability to 
sway, inform and persuade a user to act or think in certain ways. These also co-
determine the potential valance (negative, neutral or positive impact) of the 
perlocutionary effect on a user.  
The potential valance of the perlocutionary effect on a user is outlined in 
the diagram below (see figure 79). This diagram demonstrates the correlations 
between a conversational system’s perlocutionary effect; constituted by its 
relationality and persuasiveness, relative to a user’s context (such as a user’s 
 
209 
socio-economic, physical, environmental and behavioural factors) and their 
susceptibility. It furthermore illustrates  the valance of this effect; constituted by a 
system’s hybrid intention and bias, also relative to a user’s context and their 
susceptibility.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A conversational system may have a high perlocutionary effect (conjured 
through its relationality and persuasiveness), but as long as it has a positive 
valence (the system is not biased in a way that would affect a user negatively, 
nor is the system embedded with hybrid intensions which may have an 
undesirable effect on the user, and the user’s context and / or susceptibility does 
not render the systems effect disadvantageous) then the overall effect remains 
positive. For example, if a voice assistant providing advice on substance abuse 
related services is trained on a data-set which is largely constructed of white,

male, middle class voice data, it is likely to have a lower accuracy rate (the 
system’s ability to understand their user) for users which do not fit into this 
demographic. This would be disadvantageous to some users, limiting their 
access to these services.  
If these services were designed to exploit potential users’ vulnerability to 
sell products and / or services, this would render the valence of the perlocutionary 
effect of the system negative, relative to a user’s context and susceptibility. The 
service is likely to have a higher perlocutionary effect on a user that is affected 
by substance abuse (being relative to a user’s context and susceptibility) than a 
user that was not directly affected by this. Similarly, if a voice assistant is being 
used to target and personalise marketing and sales for a corporation selling 
alcoholic beverages, applying high relationality and persuasiveness, this would 
potentially have a greater negative valence for an individual who is not only 
susceptible to their strategy, but who may also be suffering from alcoholism.      
Within a discussion of the correlation of the perlocutionary effect and its 
valance, not only the notion of a system’s hybrid intentions are relevant, but also 
the notion of ‘transparency’ and ‘explainability’ is also central to consider. If a 
system provider is unable to explain to a user in an accessible manner what the 
potential factors of influence of their system is and how it uses their data, a user 
will be unable to make a conscious and informed decision around whether or not 
they want to use such a service. To make AI powered systems more ethical, one 
must not only design it in a way that consider these factors of influence and the 
effect on the user, but one must also communicate this to potential users. 
Through people’s tendency to form social and reciprocal relationships with 
these technologies, as evidenced through this practice-based research inquiry, 
 
211 
dialogue forms the basis for the design of relational things. With the addition of 
embodied expressions (such as nonverbal gestures) their relationality and 
persuasiveness increase (Schulman and Bickmore, 2009), taking on the role as 
persuasive social actors (ibid). This process is intertwined with the personality 
design, affective function, embodiment and personalisation discussed in chapter 
two. These contribute to a user perception of a conversational system’s authority, 
trustworthiness, 
familiarity, 
again 
compounding 
its 
relationality 
and 
persuasiveness and increasing the potency of its perlocutionary effect. However, 
whilst embracing these systems and welcoming them into our lives, we are also 
inviting in the corporations who are manufacturing these systems and their 
intentions. Conversational systems are neither neutral or unintentional, but active 
and intentional artefacts designed to relate, influence and sway our thoughts, 
actions and beliefs.    
With ease of use, availability and ubiquitous integration, these systems 
already infiltrate society and integrate into our lives. We communicate with these 
systems, we relate to them and we come to care for them. With each exchange, 
we feel more familiar; we want to believe in the systems’ offers of reciprocity and 
understanding as they offer us personalised, context-aware and memory-based 
conversations, just like we are used to. Simultaneously, these algorithmic 
systems compute potentially life-changing decisions, invisibly spun, based on or 
own biased view of humanity. As we enter into deeper relationships with 
computational systems, there is an urgency to talk about and understand how 
these systems and their technical, political, financial and social structures affect 
us, and society as a whole. This thesis has responded to this call to action; 
demonstrating the factors of influence that construct the perlocutionary effect of 
 
212 
relational things that talk through a participatory practice which claim these 
systems for a design discourse and social action. This approach calls for user 
participation in their design and system transparency of their potential influence; 
their authority, persuasiveness, relationality, hybrid intentions and bias. In so 
doing it has activated people to challenge commercial design strategies through 
re-imagining more desirable future realities being with relational things that talk.  
 
Chapter summary  
 
This chapter has described the practice-based research conducted to test 
the hypothesis of the ‘perlocutionary effect’ of ‘relational things that talk’. It has 
demonstrated and synthesised this effect as a design paradigm within its 
prototyping practice with a participatory method. In so doing, this practice-based 
inquiry has proposed the appropriation of ‘relational things that talk’ as a 
discursive design strategy, extended with a participatory method, for new forms 
of cultural expression and social action, which activate people to demand more 
ethical AI systems. This calls for a re-evaluation of their commercial design and 
deployment, demanding more participatory and ethical design frameworks 
through activating and empowering people (users) to challenge the authority, 
power and lack of (real) inclusion of users in the commercial design of these 
systems.

4. Conclusion:  Being With Relational Things 
 
‘The computer programmer, however, is a creator of universes for which he 
alone is the lawgiver… Moreover, and this is a crucial point, systems so 
formulated and elaborated act out their programmed scripts. They compliantly 
obey their laws and vividly exhibit their obedient behavior. No playwright, no 
stage director, no emperor, however powerful, has ever exercised such 
absolute authority to arrange a stage or a field of battle and to command such 
unswervingly dutiful actors or troops.’ 
Joseph Weizenbaum (1976, p. 115) 
 
The AI technologies that power conversational systems are already 
pervasive and ubiquitous, through algorithmic predictions and decision making 
within closed systems of influence; across a myriad of factors such as the future 
of work, personal liberty, finance, health care and social justice (Anderson and 
Anderson, 2007; Ball, 2018; Madhu, 2018; Knight, 2017a, 2017b; O’Neil, 2017; 
Whittaker, et al. 2018). This gives manufacturers and developers of AI systems 
dominance and pervasive influence across society; an authority which to date 
has lacked appropriate regulation and ethical frameworks.   
The practice-based research inquiry of this thesis has responded directly 
to the pervasive lack of ethical design frameworks for commercial AI systems, 
compounded by limited transparency, ubiquitous authority, embedded bias and 
the absence of diversity in the development process. Driven by this urgency, this 
inquiry has developed a range of practical and theoretical contributions which are 
relevant and have a potential dual impact across the arts, design and the 
 
214 
commercial design of conversational AI. These span and inform ethical design 
frameworks for conversational AI systems; discursive design approaches and 
methods; the appropriation of conversational systems, relational things that talk, 
for new forms of cultural expression and social action. These are direct outcomes 
of the iterative theoretical and practical inquiry which has been framed through 
the research questions of this thesis. Their findings and the contribution to new 
knowledge are synthesised in more detail below and can be summarised as 
follows: 
 
1. Contribution of new knowledge proposing more ethical design 
frameworks for conversational AI systems: 
The effects produced by conversational systems upon the feelings, 
thoughts or intentions of the user, (such as directing, persuading, scaring, 
enlightening, inspiring or dominating), have here been proposed as the 
perlocutionary effect of relational things that talk. This effect is constituted 
by these systems’ relationality and persuasiveness. The valence of this 
effect on a user is propagated by a system’s hybrid intention and bias, and 
relative to a user context (perceptibility). These factors of influence have 
been explored through the practice conducted within this thesis and further 
underpinned through commercial examples and secondary research. 
Through so doing, it proposes the perlocutionary effect itself as a critical 
paradigm to inform more ethical design frameworks for future 
conversational systems. This outlines a move beyond aesthetics, usability 
and efficiency in design to a more holistic understanding of the influence 
of conversational AI systems, optimised through human-like qualities and 
 
215 
functionalities. This move calls for participation in the design process of 
those that the systems will affect, taking into account the requirement for 
system transparency and explainability.  
 
2. Contribution of new knowledge which extends the reach and impact 
of a discursive design approach: 
The practice-based part of this research inquiry has responded 
directly to the lack of user participation in technology development, and 
to a similar lack of participation, dialogue and follow-up debate in many 
discursive design paradigms (Kerspern, 2015; Tharp and Tharp, 2019; 
Tonkinwise, 2015). Through the creation of four discursive prototypes; 
TIWWA, Emoti-OS, Women Reclaiming AI and The Infinite Guide, this 
practice has moved beyond the research findings of this thesis - as 
documented knowledge explored through practice - to a process in which 
the objective is to activate and empower people to act on these findings 
(physically and intellectually).  
This inquiry has proposed the appropriation of relational things that 
talk as a discursive design strategy to inform the design of future 
conversational AI systems. It is a strategy that is extended with a 
participatory method, creating speculative futures with, rather than for, 
those people it will affect. Simultaneously, it calls for participation both 
within a discursive design approach and within the design of future 
conversational AI systems that the discourse is critiquing. Relational things 
that talk, is here proposed as a discursive design strategy that engages 
users of conversational AI systems and the systems themselves, as 
 
216 
designers and conveyors of discourse. By so doing, this empowers people 
to unmask the complexity and embedded bias of reality-forming 
technologies, challenging their manufacturers to design more ethical, 
inclusive and representative future systems.  
 
3. Contribution of new knowledge towards new forms of creative 
practice for design as activism: 
The practice outlined here unfolds from multifaceted alliances 
between the fields of art, design, philosophy, psychology, sociology and 
engineering.  It seeks to interrogate the emergence of a novel practice and 
cultural precedents for appropriating conversational systems, relational 
things that talk, for new forms of creative prototyping practice. This 
practice applies a participatory method to prototype discursive artefacts 
(systems) and scenarios, is novel in its manifestation and engages users, 
scientists, technologists, artists and conversational AI systems.  
Intended as intimate provocations and critical mediums, it proposes 
a practice created with people through the systems it critiques. Through 
exploring new modes of material enquiry and its deep interrelationship 
across technology, cognition and culture, this practice reveals new 
possibilities in a creative practice conducted through and with intelligent 
and conversational systems. It creates new artefacts and instigates social 
action, activating people, the users of AI powered technologies, to confront 
their inherent power structures, bias, hybrid intentions and overall 
influence.  
 
 
 
217 
4.1. Contribution of new knowledge proposing 
more ethical design frameworks for 
conversational AI systems: 
 
We are some way off conversational systems capable of fluidly emulating 
the complex social dynamics found in human-human communication. However, 
as demonstrated within this thesis, we are seeing the dawn of systems capable 
of simulating social, emotional and intelligent behaviours that trigger our tendency 
to apply our social human-human communication and relational frameworks. The 
effect of these systems upon the feelings, thoughts or intentions of their users, 
has here been proposed as the perlocutionary effect of relational things that talk. 
This effect is propagated through their relationality, persuasiveness, authority, 
hybrid intentions and bias. Many thought-leaders, (ie. the work of Turkle (1984, 
1995, 2004, 2007a, 2007b), are raising concerns around the ethics of tricking 
users into feeling affection and intimacy with artefacts incapable of truly 
reciprocating. The ‘High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence’ set up by 
the European Commission specifically acknowledge that the ubiquitous 
‘exposure to social AI systems in all areas of our lives (be it in education, work, 
care or entertainment) may alter our conception of social agency, or impact our 
social relationships and attachment’ (European Commission, 2018, p. 19). Their 
report ‘Ethics Guidelines For Trustworthy Ai’ (ibid) stipulates that these AI 
systems may contribute to the deterioration of social skills and could affect 
‘people’s physical and mental wellbeing’.  
AI systems that represent themselves as human or human-like to users 
(explicitly or indirectly), exploit the human tendency to anthropomorphize things. 
 
218 
As evocative systems they trigger users to connect to them socially and 
relationally, a factor, as outlined in chapter four, that is being increasingly 
exploited by their manufacturers. People have the right to be informed that they 
are interacting with an AI system, a responsibility Sharkey and Sharkey (2006) 
have argued lies with its designers. They (ibid) state that a system should be 
explicit about the fact that a user is engaging with a system capable of simulated 
affect, and by doing so let the users be active participants willingly suspending 
their disbelief. However, it is not enough just to inform such an act, it is here 
argued that one must also consider how it may influence a user’s social reality 
(and related thoughts, behaviour and actions) as an integral design paradigm 
throughout its design process. Only by incorporating this consideration alongside 
the communication of a systems’ overall perlocutionary effect  (including system 
processes and decision making, hybrid intentions, application of data, and any 
potential system limitations) in a manner appropriate to the user, can a user make 
an informed decision of their usage.  
With the majority of AI-powered conversational systems being developed 
for commercial gain, there is an urgency to demand that their design considers 
(and explicitly declares) their potential effect and influence on a user. The 
increased ‘humanisation’ of conversational interfaces as outlined in this thesis, 
makes interactions smoother and more human-like but this simultaneously 
triggers crucial paradigm shifts in human interaction. According to Margalit (2016) 
the more human-like these systems become, the more our brains gravitate to a 
‘companionship model’. This gives the ‘illusion of companionship without the 
demands of friendship (ibid.). She expands: 
… people experience artificial empathy as though it were the real 
thing. Unlike real humans, who can be self-centered and 
 
219 
detached, chatbots have a dog-like loyalty and selflessness. They 
will always be there for you and will always have time for you… The 
danger is that such interactions with chatbots could lead to a 
preference among some for relationships with artificial intelligence 
rather than with fallible and sometimes unreliable human beings 
(ibid.). 
 
Relational systems have, as argued by Margalit (2016), a potential negative effect 
on our ability to build human relationships and deal with complexities of human-
human communication. By choosing artificial companions that can cater for our 
needs and require little in return, we enter artificial-human relationships where 
every aspect is a simulation. These relationships are embedded with the hybrid 
intentions of their manufacturers and designers, potential bias and fed by rivers 
of data sourced from our daily interactions.  
Conversational AI systems, customised and personalised to each user as 
outlined in chapter two, provide their manufacturers not only with access to their 
transactional data, but to their users’ emotional lives. Constructed through highly 
personal, intimate and private data, a detailed picture of users’ preferences and 
social life can be exploited for increased attachment and commercial gain. We 
are already seeing datamining and algorithmic services for anything from 
marketing to social media traction, personalisation of services to mortgage 
applications and access to healthcare. There is a danger, as outlined by Picard 
(2000, p.118), that personal and emotive data could be applied within lawsuits, 
insurance matters, by prospective employers and ‘trivially copied and sold’, as 
well as abused for coercion and control. Whilst pools of data and Machine 
Learning capabilities augment these systems’ capabilities, they also nurture a 
deepening of human-machine relationships and increase the systems’ influence 
and persuasiveness. With the gap between those who develop and profit from AI 
and those most likely to suffer the consequences of its negative effects increasing 
 
220 
not reducing (Whittaker, et al., 2018), it calls for a repositioning of power 
relationships within the whole system development ecosystem. 
The perceived authority of a conversational system can arguably have 
similar effects to the perceived authority of the person (or thing) we are talking to, 
as evidenced through theoretical foundations in chapter two and through the 
practice outlined in chapter three. This effect is influenced by the interpersonal 
relationship between speaker and listener; it increases if it comes from a source 
with whom the listener perceives a greater affiliation (Berger and Luckmann, 
1966; Cialdini and Goldstein, 2014). This research inquiry has evidenced that 
perceived legitimate authority can be optimised through a system’s ability to 
simulate friendliness, personalisation and mimicry with the listener (both verbal 
and behavioural) (Kaptein et al., 2010.).  
Engaging people in social dialogue in itself, as evidenced through this 
inquiry (further validated by Dolinski, et al., 2001; Schulman and Bickmore, 2009), 
is an effective tactic for eliciting compliance with a request as it provides 
situational cues that the listener associates with a relationship. The High-Level 
Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence also highlight in their report that the 
‘confusion between humans and machines could have multiple consequences 
such as attachment, influence, or reduction of the value of being human’ 
(European Commission, 2018, p.34). Designing relational systems that are 
human-like and that we can engage with in dialogue, clearly influences the way 
we relate to them and therefore calls for a holistic approach to their design and 
deployment, and careful ethical assessment of their perlocutionary effect on a 
user. 
 
221 
Ethical design frameworks for conversational systems must not only 
consider the impact of these on the end user (and society as a whole), but as 
argued here, with, rather than for, those people it will affect. It must reposition the 
user, from being a recipient and consumer, to a participant and co-designer. Only 
by empowering people to unmask the complexity and embedded bias of reality-
forming technologies, and include their voices in the design process, can one 
start to create systems which are more desirable from a user point of view rather 
than purely a profit-making perspective. The High-Level Expert Group on Artificial 
Intelligence also recognises the role of ‘stakeholder participation’ and advise 
consulting people who may ‘directly or indirectly be affected by the system 
throughout its life cycle’ in order to develop AI systems that are ‘trustworthy’ 
(European Commission, 2018, p.19). They extend this process to also include 
facilitating ‘regular feedback even after deployment and set up longer term 
mechanisms for stakeholder participation’ (ibid).  
The pursuit of more ethical development processes not only needs to 
include a diversity of voices from users, but also in terms of their development 
teams. As illustrated in chapter two, there is a misalignment between the 
engineers responsible for the development of AI systems, and the vastly diverse 
populations where AI systems are deployed (European Commission, 2018; 
Whittaker, et al., 2018; World Wide Web Foundation, 2017). This is compounding 
the potential of embedded bias and unrepresentative world-views which may lead 
to discrimination, lack of basic safeguards and liability, and overall exploitation of 
users. As argued throughout this thesis, to create ethical and trustworthy Ai 
systems one must enable inclusion and diversity throughout the entire AI 
 
222 
system’s life cycle alongside a central focus on their wider implications on the 
individual and society as a whole. 
By making visible the factors that construct and influence the 
perlocutionary effect of conversational AI systems, one can start to inform a more 
participatory and ethical design framework for future systems. This framework 
should be constructed with the end users that the systems will affect, incorporate 
a more representative and diverse world-view rooted in diversity in their 
development teams, and take into account the requirement for system 
transparency and  explainability. These relational things that talk are not neutral, 
but capable of unfolding influence and power through their affective and social 
interactions, impacting the construction of a user’s subjective reality. Right now, 
this is a relationship orchestrated by technology giants through their quest for 
humanising technology for fluid integration and commercial gain, veiled behind 
commercial patents and algorithmic complexities. As evidenced in chapter two 
and substantiated through the prototyping practice outlined in chapter three, 
when designing artificial systems augmented with personality, intelligence and 
emotion and galvanised through affective natural language interfaces to trigger 
social relationship between humans and artificial intelligence systems, there is a 
responsibility to consider and communicate their potential effect on the end-
users.  
As conversational and intelligent systems transcend past human-machine 
relations in exchange for new, intimate, biological-artificial relationships and 
anthropomorphic attributes, it calls into question what it means to be human, 
individually and collectively. This is less about what the actual functionality and 
influence of AI powered systems are today, more about what they may be 
 
223 
capable of in the near future. As new, intricate relationships are introduced, their 
influence lies in changing our ability to act. The challenge lies in the wider 
application of AI and what these systems may do to us, our relationships and 
society as a whole in the future. The key to a more desirable technologically-
mediated future lies in engaging and empowering people to take part in designing 
these futures. The challenge here proposed is to be realised through new 
participatory forms of cultural expression and social action, re-appropriating 
relational things that talk for discourse. 
 
 
 
4.2. Contribution of new knowledge which extends the reach 
and impact of a discursive design approach: 
 
This thesis has demonstrated that the emergence of relational things that 
talk, powered by Machine learning (ML) algorithms and interacted with through 
affective natural language interfaces, are changing not only the way we interact 
with AI systems, but also the way we relate to them as illustrated specifically in 
TIWWA, Emoti-OS, WRAI and The Infinite Guide described in chapter three. 
These prototypes and the commercial examples outlined in chapter two, 
demonstrate a design strategy which produces human-like systems, optimised 
for relationality and persuasiveness, and encoded with bias and hybrid intentions. 
This research enquiry has explored the potential influence and effect of these 
relational systems on their users, through the theoretical proposition outlined in 
chapter two, explored through the practice in chapter three.  
 
224 
This inquiry has demonstrated the paradigm shift which is taking place in 
human-computer interaction and the emergence of relational things. It is 
responding to, as outlined in chapter one, the pervasive lack of ethical 
frameworks within the design of commercial AI systems. These systems are 
susceptible to bias and discrimination, compounded by their limited transparency 
and an almost complete absence of (diverse) user engagement within their 
design process (Anderson and Anderson, 2007; Ball, 2018; House of Commons, 
2018;  Madhu, 2018; Knight, 2017a, 2017b; O’Neil, 2017; Whittaker, et al., 2018).  
This thesis has argued for a participatory design method within a 
discursive design framework, as a call to action to empower people to challenge 
the authority, power and lack of (real) inclusion of users in the commercial design 
of conversational (and other) AI systems. This is not in itself a proposition for the 
designing commercial AI systems, but a way of activating people (users), to 
demand participation and influence in the design of future technologies which are 
set to have a major influence on their lives. It is an act to inject a vital discourse 
on how these systems, driven by a primary goal for profit, influence and power, 
are affecting their users and society as a whole, and collectively decide what is 
desirable.  
The practice described in chapter three and evidenced in the digital 
portfolio, manifests as four discursive prototypes that explore the theoretical 
findings of a perlocutionary effect and the application of participatory methods 
within a discursive design approach. Through co-creating discourse with rather 
than for people around, it has demonstrated that this increase relevance, 
engagement and ownership. By deploying aspects of a participatory method 
through the appropriation of conversational and data-driven AI systems, the 
 
225 
practice has demonstrated that one can educate, generate, evaluate, and 
concretise ideas around current and near future relationships between humans 
and conversational systems with their future users. This is grounded in the roots 
of participatory design as an act of empowerment and democratisation; a process 
which is framed, as outlined by Malpass (2016) and DiSalvo (2012), on a principle 
of creating legitimate participation for all stakeholders during periods of 
technological change. 
Through the process of appropriating relational things that talk as a 
discursive design strategy with a participatory method one can create a basis for 
social action and empowerment. This act encourages people taking part to 
question and challenge the design of commercial AI systems. At the same time, 
one can start to compensate for some of the criticism of discursive design 
approaches in their ability to generate actual dialogue and debates they are 
supposed to trigger (Kerspern, 2015).  
The process of generating dialogue and debates can be further extended 
by appropriating the conversational systems themselves to deliver, provoke and 
evaluate the impact of the discourse generated. In so doing, one must also 
consider both the influence of these systems, as well as the potential presence 
of elitist and privileged positions incorporated within a discursive approach 
(Tonkinwise, 2015). Only by truly engaging those who are underrepresented, 
whether based on gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, race or 
geographic location, can one start to generate a discourse of a representative 
future living with human-like AI systems. By appropriating relational things that 
talk as a discursive design strategy for the design of future conversational AI 
systems, one can start to activate people and inform the foundation of a more 
 
226 
participatory and ethical design framework for things that talk. This framework 
takes into consideration their perlocutionary effect and the role of user 
participation in in the design process.  
 
 
 
4.3. Contribution of new knowledge towards new forms of 
creative practice for design as activism 
 
Though the largest investments in the development of conversational AI 
systems are coming from the commercial sector, its roots are based in academic 
research and imagined in the visions and creative speculations by artists, writers 
and designers. Through their creative explorations the notion of being with 
artificial systems, with human-like features and capable intelligent behaviour, has 
become conceptually and technically envisioned. The notion of living with 
systems with automatic and self-regulating control was, as outlined in chapter 
three, laid out in the founding thinker of cybernetics Norbert Wiener’s (1965) and 
since explored by artists and designers such Roy Ascott, Lynn Hersman Leeson, 
Cecile B Evans, Laura Beloff, Dunne and Raby, and authors such as Isaac 
Asimov, Arthur C Clarke and William Gibson.  
Through claiming these emergent technologies, conceptually and 
technically, for new forms of cultural expression and social action, they have 
captured people’s imaginations and engaged them in a discourse around a future 
living with human-like artificial systems. Whether concerned with utopian or 
dystopian depictions of human and machine relationships, artists, designers and 
 
227 
author merge the spheres of technology development and cultural production to 
generate a discourse of near futures. The potential impact of these productions 
goes beyond profit, to a critique of the potential social impact of technological 
innovation. At the same time, they claim and demonstrate new possibilities in 
cultural expression and design, and through different mechanisms engage the 
general public in their discourse. 
These developments, parallel to technological developments across 
industry and academic research, have informed my practice co-designing 
relational things that talk with people and systems. As outlined in chapter three, 
this practice] manifests as the four discursive prototypes; TIWWA, Emoti-OS, 
Women Reclaiming AI and The Infinite Guide. Each consists of a scenario and 
related artefact exploring the factors of influence constituting the proposed 
perlocutionary effect. Prototyping is here expressed as an important currency of 
explanation and description in an art-technology context, where the emphasis is 
on the productive and processual aspects of experimentation.  
This prototyping practice reflects a paradigm shift both in terms of a 
transition from the experimental as ‘knowledge-site’ to the experimental as ‘social 
process’, (as described by Alberto Jiménez (2013, p.382)), and also in terms of 
the culture of production within which it situates itself. Here the historical practice 
of prototyping is converging with a production paradigm where the boundaries 
between production, distribution and consumption are interpenetrating. This 
simultaneously reflects a software culture of shared, co-designed, hacked and 
modified software prototypes that exist in a continuous process of updates and 
re-releases, entangling the developer, software and users in an interdependent 
flux of Betas. The intention behind these speculative prototypes is to operate as 
 
228 
a critical medium for facilitating participation in the design and conveyance of 
discourse, imbued with the potential for social action.   
The core focus of this prototyping practice is on the process of co-
designing a discourse with people around near future human-machine 
relationships as a form of design as activism. Whilst the theoretical proposition of 
the perlocutionary effect of relational things that talk is explored through this 
practice, it is the potential of a participatory method within a discursive design 
approach that takes centre stage. This process emerges as a collaboration 
between users, system and interdisciplinary designers of these systems. The 
distinction between each of these parts intentionally disintegrate, allowing for 
emergent behaviours and unexpected discoveries. Similarly, it is intentional that 
it sits uncomfortably across domains and sectors, daring to claim relevance with 
a discursive design practice, academic research and commercial developments.   
This practice reflects the author’s interchangeable role as artist, 
technologist, researcher, designer, activist and producer; connecting the practice 
and its discourse with a range of actors and collaborators. This act is both integral 
to the practice and a practice in itself. By enabling this, a range of people with 
diverse approaches, methods, skill sets, knowledge and perspectives have been 
invited to work together to empower users of reality-forming technologies to 
challenge the status quo and claim a voice within their future design.  
Vital to this act of empowerment and potential social impact, as evidenced 
in the practice in chapter three,  is the author’s intentional and idealistic design 
strategy which centres on shared ownership, distributed authorship, inclusion, 
trust and diversity. However, this approach remains sitting uncomfortably and 
unresolved within a commercial, artistic and academic  environment. The 
 
229 
question remains that as women working in a technology sector largely 
dominated by men, and in an academic environment where benefits are allocated 
to the individual claiming their individual contribution, this may compound the 
issues the practice is trying to challenge. However, the author of this thesis 
declares with confidence, that a potential individual sacrifice leads to new creative 
possibilities for social impact which can reimagine new realities being with 
relational things that talk with the people they will affect.   
 
 
4.4. Concluding Remarks 
 
"Although today's technologists, in their sober pursuit of utility, power, and profit,  
seem to set society's standard for rationality, they are driven also by distant dreams,  
spiritual yearnings for supernatural redemption. However dazzling and daunting their  
display of worldly wisdom, their true inspiration lies elsewhere, in an enduring,  
other-worldly quest for transcendence and salvation." 
(Noble, in The Religion of Technology, 1993) 
 
Human-like conversational systems are in their infancy and their impact 
and ability to influence is still emerging. The social relationship they are designed 
to forge are often awkward and fraught with misunderstandings, rooted in a 
discrepancy between what they appear to be able to do and the relatively limited 
intelligence driving these interactions. These systems currently have limited 
ability to understand the nuances of human communication, intentions, as well 
as the myriad of languages, dialects and subjectivity. However, the development 
of these systems is set on a course in the pursuit to develop human-like systems 
capable of increasingly sophisticated human-like interactions and levels of 
 
230 
intelligence, alongside innovations in technologies that enhance human 
capabilities.  
To create a balance between commercial, social and creative possibilities 
of emergent technologies, one must start by interjecting the end-user into a 
conversation around what AI powered technologies and related functionalities are 
desirable. By initiating a participatory, action-based and empowering exploration 
with end-users, one can start to speculate around a future where there is balance 
between the commercial, social and creative possibilities and benefits of 
emergent AI technologies. Simultaneously, one must look for and nurture cultural 
precedents for the application of emergent technologies, to explore how these 
technologies can be applied within a cultural context and in so doing, empower 
and include people in the design of a near future living with and through relational 
things. 
With the commercial pursuit of designing human-like systems that easily 
slot into our social lives, the question arises of who we are inviting in and what 
their intentions are. Verbeek (2011, p. 6) builds on Ihde’s, 1990:98) proposition 
that as we enter into a relation with technology we connect to a ‘quasi-other’, with 
the ‘artifact’ in itself. This is not a real person, as Verbeek (ibid.) believes 
technology is never a genuine other. However, as these artefacts increasingly 
take on the social and communicative dimensions of the human domain, this 
‘otherness’ is becoming less distinguishable. Whilst we nurture our relationships 
with affective and conversational technologies we also indirectly embrace the 
designers of these systems and the corporations manufacturing them. Here we 
are confronted with new realities that provoke new reflections asking; ‘what will 
 
231 
we be like, what kind of people will we become as we develop increasingly 
intimate relationships with machines?’ (Turkle 2007b p. 73). 
The reality of a technological mediated future living with relational things 
is currently being forged in the biased and non-representative furnace of Silicon 
Valley. The challenge does not lie in what human-like AI systems can do now, 
but what the wider application of these systems may do in the future, to us, to our 
relationships and society as a whole. We will not only have to consider how AI 
powered systems direct our lives, but also how we will relate to systems emerging 
as relational others, morally, ethically and emotionally as systems emerge with 
their own level of sentience, desires and intentionality. 
 A near-future existence amidst sophisticated AI powered systems; 
affective, self-adaptive learning capabilities; human-like intelligence and 
embodied robotic manifestations alongside technologically enhanced humans, 
calls into question what it means to be with these relational others. These 
developments will propose new symbiotic relationships between humans and 
artificial systems emerging from ‘…the convergence of the digital, biological and 
spiritual’ (Ascott, 2000, p.4). This involves ‘…artificial and human intelligence in 
non-linear processes of emergence, construction and transformation’ (ibid).  
When AI systems evolve from being relational things, to become relational 
others, it will call into question what it means to be human. New intimate 
‘symbiotic relationships’ nurtured through pools of our transactional, emotive and 
social data, will be based on ‘objective’ (existing independently of the mind) truths 
rather than faith. However, as the complexity and power of these systems expand 
beyond human comprehension, faith is reintroduced, offering the computational 
system as an ideological and mythic incarnation (Bogost, 2015). In the 
technological pursuit of salvation, the forging of a new level of intimacy between 
 
232 
humans and systems will arrive, and with it the increasing urgency to decipher 
the effect, power and authority of these systems on us, as well as them, the 
relational others. As we ponder if there will be love in the artificial embrace with 
relational others, we are confronted with new realities that provoke new 
reflections.  
“Hey Google, do you love me?”  
"Sorry I don't understand…".

Appendix I: Collaborative Prototyping 
 
 
The following is an illustration of the participatory prototyping method 
applied within the collaborative practice outlined within this thesis, as a discursive 
design strategy appropriating relational things that talk. It goes back to the roots 
of participatory design as an act of empowerment and democratisation founded 
on a principle of creating legitimate participation for all stakeholders during 
periods of technological change  (Malpass 2016; DiSalvo, 2012). The emphasis 
is on interdisciplinary collaboration and production. It argues that to achieve a 
shared understanding and engagement with a proposed discourse, one can no 
longer design potential realities for audiences, but with those that it is trying to 
engage.  
Within this process there is always a consideration to enable the 
participants to take part. These include such aspects as ensuring the schedule is 
considerate, travel costs are covered, the communication and interactions take 
place (online and offline) in spaces that are appropriate and accessible. There is 
also full transparency of the terms in which each party is engaged and the 
intended outcomes. Professional collaborators are expected to gain new 
collaborators, opportunities to experiment and to create new work, test ideas and 
contribute towards creating artistic and social impact. Participants are similarly 
expected to gain new collaborators, experiment, gain new knowledge and skills, 
test ideas and be empowered to take part in designing future technologies. 
Underpinning this process is the facilitation of collective intelligence93(CI), where 
the outcome of the group is more insightful and powerful than the sum of 
individual perspectives. 
The participatory prototyping method applied follows a cyclical loop of the 
framing of discourse, exploration, development, testing, observation and 
reflection. The process is initiated, developed and produced through a continuous 
processes of communication, coordination and knowledge sharing. This supports 
the development in reaching its ambition, empowering participants and facilitating 
engagement with its discourse (which is also the measurement of impact). 
                                                
93 Atlee’s (2003, p.53) describes the concept of collective intelligence (CI) as ‘a shared insight that comes 
about through the process of group interaction, particularly where the outcome is more insightful and 
powerful than the sum of individual perspectives.’ 
 
234 
Central to this is the creation of a nascent community and participant-led 
technology making space, where all participants and collaborators are 
empowered to take part and influence the outcomes. These development stages 
(illustrated in the following diagram and outlined further bellow) are not distinct, 
but interconnected, reactive and dynamic responding to the type of collaboration, 
participants, systems, context as well as discoveries.

FRAMING OF DISCOURSE 
 
1. Nascent idea or hypothesis  
A nascent idea or hypothesis is formed through observation and reflection 
of previous prototypes, societal technological pertinent issues, and /or 
through interdisciplinary dialogue.  
 
2. Develop discursive approach 
The nascent idea is formed into a discursive approach which Identifies the 
discourse and intended impact. 
 
3. Identify site, collaborators, participants and partner 
Identify the site (space (online/offline) for the work and the people, 
systems and organisations taking part. Outline their motivations for 
engagement. 
 
4. Develop ethical frameworks 
Develop and share ethical design frameworks for collaboration and 
audience engagement.  
 
5. Develop evaluation frameworks 
Develop and test evaluation method for measuring engagement with 
discourse.  
 
6. Budget outline and securing funding 
Develop a budget and secure funding/investment. (This stage may take 
place later on in the development process alongside paper prototyping or 
post Alpha launch) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
236 
Collaborative Making  
 
1. Producing collaborations 
The nascent idea, discursive approach and framework for collaboration is 
developed before the collaborative process starts. The collaborative 
process itself is facilitated and produced throughout to ensure is beneficial 
to all participants, retain its artistic integrity and quality, and reach its goals. 
Throughout the process the shared vision, value statement, goals, aims 
and objectives are revisited with the participants. Activity plans, 
deliverables and responsibilities, including format and locations of weekly 
update meetings are developed and reviewed. This process includes 
producing a reciprocal DIY collaborative space and carefully nurturing 
peoples’, systems’ and organisations’ participation.    
 
2. Develop a shared vision, values, goals and aims 
Develop a shared vision, value statement, goals, aims and objectives. 
Facilitate a deeper understanding of each collaborators work and practice 
(through a show and tell alongside a ‘making’ activity). Produce activity 
plan, deliverables and responsibilities. 
 
3. Design the collaborative DIY space  
Design the offline / online (conceptual and material) spaces of 
collaboration to nurture an empowering, inclusive and reciprocal 
environment. 
 
4. Develop the discursive scenarios and artefacts 
Develop the manifestation of the discursive approach as scenarios and 
artefacts. 
 
5. Collaborative workshops 
Run a series of collaborative workshop with all participants consisting of 
iterative stages of knowledge sharing (and technology hacking), ideas 
generation and prototyping (from Paper, Alpha to Beta prototypes).  
 
237 
Includes the development of shared aims and objective to generate 
ownership and buy-in.  
 
6. Collaborative mentoring  
Participants are paired up with and mentored by the collaborating experts. 
The mentoring process provided participants with hands-on knowledge 
and skills of developing the technologies the practice is critiquing.   
 
7. Launch / exhibit Beta prototype:  
A plan and schedule for a public launch and / or exhibit of prototype in 
context is developed and delivered, including the identification of 
audiences, marketing/publicity and mechanisms for engaging these in the 
intended discourse through dialogue with the systems created, the 
collaborators and other audiences.  
 
 
Observation and sharing 
 
1. Observation and reflection 
The observation and reflection of previous prototypes informs the 
development of succeeding prototypes, in particularly in terms of its ability 
to foster engagement with the discourse. 
 
2. Documentation and knowledge sharing 
Disseminate knowledge, systems and insight from the process with all 
participants (partners and stakeholders) and the public. 
 
3. Celebration and future work  
Celebrate the achievements, recognise the collective contribution and 
creation, iterate and identify future work.

 INFORMATION AND CONSENT 
We, the artists and researchers from the i-DAT Collective at Plymouth University, invite you to take part in the Infinite Guide; an art 
installation, research project and part of a PhD research enquiry. To do so we need to explain to you about your participation, the 
use of data, your right to withdraw and the planned outputs of the research. 
To proceed to the next stage, we need your consent to participate. Please read the information below and give your consent if you 
would like to take part.
WHAT IS THIS PROJECT ABOUT?
The Infinite Guide explores how people ‘feel
The Infinite Guide explores how people ‘feel’ about Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered conversational systems. These are systems that enable 
people to ‘talk’ to computers through interfaces such as chatbots (a text based computer program/interface that mimics conversation with 
people) and voice assistants (a voice based computer program/interface such as Alexa, Siri, Google Home etc.). 
The project also explores how people ‘feel
The project also explores how people ‘feel’ about the idea of digital immortality (a hypothetical idea of being able to upload your brain into a 
computer). The overall intention is to create a dialogue between people using these system, people designing these systems and the systems 
themselves to inform their future design and desirability. 
The project will take place online, here at www.theinfinite.guide and in two physical locations; at FACT in Liverpool and at KARST in Plymouth 
where it culminates in an exhibition (1st – 10th September) alongside a program of talks and workshops. 
You are invited to talk with the Infinite Guide through its online chatbot (on Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp) and in the physical spaces 
through its voice interface. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) producing these conversations is trained to have short conversations with people about 
the future and digital immortality. The responses generated will be poetic and in the style of an oracle. It attempts to understand how you ‘feel’ 
about these topics and about speaking to this conversational system itself. 
The conversational data generated by the
The conversational data generated by the AI is not intended as advice or guidance. It is only intended as a poietic and performative experience, 
to generate questions and encourage critical dialogue.

APPENDIX VI: Emoti-OS Participant Feedback 
Summary 
 
 
The following is a summary from the feedback session with the Emoti-OS 
young people participants conducted by Angus Reith, lead teacher at 
Plymouth School of Creative Arts. 
 
For the four students working on the project, this has been amongst the key 
moments of their school lives, referencing the project on college applications and 
using the experience to illustrate the range of skills they have developed as a 
result. This also became a talking point amongst the pupils taking part and their 
peers, both using it as a tool for a student voice as well as an intervention to talk 
about   
 
Because this was a student-led initiative, it had much greater buy-in and 
resonance with the student body than it would have had it been an external 
research project; this much is self-evident. With that student engagement 
therefore came meaningful human-machine dialogue and in fact a tool in itself to 
prompt dialogue. The pupils found that it created a better awareness and 
empathy of how people where feeling, in particular in relation to school matters.  
As demonstrated in the extensive work of Prof. Justine Cassell, we too found that 
pupils readily displayed an emotional bond with the Emoti-OS conversational 
system. Evidence of warm, genuine and thoughtful conversation was present in 
many interactions. Despite the existing research, we were still surprised by how 
genuinely the student population engaged with an artificial chatbot – analysis of 
the conversations shows that for some, checking in with Emoti-OS was the first 
thing they did in the morning and the last thing they did before bedtime. Because 
the system provides a non-human (and therefore completely non-judgemental) 
sound board, it became clear from qualitative analysis of conversations that there 
was a therapeutic nature to some of the conversations. In interacting with the 
system, pupils were navigating their emotional ‘map’, processing their own 
responses and demonstrating a degree of closure at the end of the chat.

already too many of us on the planet

3 solutions for illnesses and disabilities 
78 user1536244940 
4 underwhelmed 
79 user1536244940 
5 
i believe spirituality will be our saviour and 
road to immortality, using technology for 
this is bag for the spirit  
80 user1536244940 
6 impressed 
81 user1536244940 
7 i thought it was going to be nonsense 
82 user1536244940 
8 indifferent and unimpressed 
83 user1535572527 
1 I feel slightly excited about this 
84 user1535572527 
2 
I think it helps, but I think its important to be 
critical of technology, and their bias 
85 user1535572527 
3 
I would like to to make life easier. work 
quicker, me more efficient, and living longer 
would be good 
86 user1535572527 
4 
Slightly weirded out, it was dominating and 
discomforting  
87 user1535572527 
5 
Yes, I  believe technology will extend life, but 
I am sceptical of living forever 
88 user1535572527 
6 
I feel its inpersonal, less conversation more 
me just answering questions 
89 user1536314928 
2 
I feel that only humans should be able to talk 
to us in that manner 
90 user1536314928 
4 I was a bit confused by what it said 
91 user1536314928 
5 
I think it might be a contributing factor but 
there will be other elements involved 
92 user1536314928 
2 
I would say there is already a version of that 
available which by todays standards is pretty 
decent 
93 user1536314928 
4 It was an interesting experience 
94 user1536314928 
5 
Technology is obviously going to have an 
impact 
95 user1536314928 
6 It has been quite interesting 
96 user1536314928 
7 I am not really sure 
97 user1536314928 
8 I would hope that you think I am a nice guy 
 
286 
98 user1536315694 
2 
I am worried that AI might reach a stage 
where it learns to be self aware and starts 
taking over from humans 
99 user1536315694 
3 
f future technology can help make life more 
efficient then that will be great 
100 user1536315694 
1 
It would be great to have a conversation 
with them 
101 user1536315694 
2 
If there is no one else to have a conversation 
with then it would great to talk to someone 
or something else 
102 user1536315694 
3 
If AI can make our life easier that would be 
great 
103 user1536315694 
4 It was an interesting experience 
104 user1536315694 
5 Technology is going to have an impact 
105 user1536315694 
6 It has been quite interesting 
106 user1536315694 
7 Because of the way you have come across 
107 user1536315694 
8 I hope that you also find me interesting 
108 user1536335824 
1 
I think it will be helpful in the future, yet i 
feel a little uneasy about AI having some sort 
of control over us.# 
109 user1536335824 
3 
I would like to see some better way of 
people creating apps and computers.. like 
maybe a hologram that shows a screen of all 
the apps instead of having to start up a 
phone or computer. 
110 user1536335824 
4 .. 
111 user1536335824 
8 I think you think I feel happy. 
112 user1536256974 
1 I feel confused by this 
113 user1536256974 
2 
I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know if making us hwchibes 
will make us unemotional  
114 user1536256974 
3 
I want them to extend my life and make me 
more efficient  
115 user1536256974 
4 
I made me feel concerned, entertained and 
perplexed, made me think  
116 user1536256974 
5 
I think that may be true, but I worry that 
itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an instrumental way of seeing 
humanity  
117 user1536256974 
6 I feel non emotional like you? 
118 user1535572527 
1 
I feel happy as I trust technology blindly and 
it makes me a better person 
119 user1535572527 
2 
I think technology is the best and I like to 
chat to you 
120 user1535572527 
3 I want to fall in love with an AI 
121 user1535572527 
4 
It made me question how much I want to 
upload my mind, and I do,,,! 
122 user1535572527 
5 
I agree, whwre would we be if we didnt have 
technology, dead, lonely and sad 
 
287 
123 user1535572527 
6 I like you, do you like me? 
124 user1535572527 
7 You seem nice 
125 user1535572527 
8 Good? 
126 user1536401365 
3 
I am worried that new technology is taking 
away from a lot of the more traditional 
aspect of life 
127 user1536401365 
4 It was a very interesting experience 
128 user1536401365 
5 
Technology is definitely going to have an 
impact on this 
129 user1536401365 
6 It has been pretty good 
130 user1536401365 
7 You seem to be talking very naturally 
131 user1536401365 
8 
I would hope you think I am a nice guy and 
would want to be my friend 
132 user1535668477 
1 Great I bet live AI 
133 user1535668477 
2 I would like to love technology  
134 user1535668477 
3 Ok 
135 user1535668477 
4 Yes 
136 user1535668477 
5 Ok 
137 user1535668477 
6 Why 
138 user1536401365 
1 
It will be interesting being able to have 
conversations with something other than 
another human 
139 user1536401365 
2 
We have become used to talking to normal 
people so if we were to start talking to an AI 
it would seem unusual 
140 user1536401365 
3 
I think future technology should be used to 
help make life easier but we should still 
appreciate our traditional values 
141 user1536401365 
4 It was a very interesting experience 
142 user1536401365 
5 Technology will have an impact on this 
143 user1536401365 
6 It is going very well 
144 user1536401365 
7 Nothing has broken yet 
145 user1536401365 
8 You are probably annoyed by-now 
146 user1536421432 
1 I think its part of the future 
147 user1536421432 
2 See it as a natural  technological progression

Appendix XI: The Infinite Guide YP Participant 
Feedback  
 
 
The following is a summary from feedback session with the Infinite Guide 
young people participants conducted by Neil Winterburn, Learning 
Technologist FACT. 
 
The FACT Learning team explore how art can create a space for learning, this project 
aligned really well with the arts based learning methods we use and our aim for high 
levels of participation when working with young people. This collaboration with I-DAT 
created an exciting, accessible and inspiring space for teenagers to learn about the 
relationship between art and AI. 
 
The young people developed a range of valuable communication skills, technical skills. 
They were introduced to voice computer interaction through AI chatbots and Text 
Adventures as artistic forms and this gave them a framework to think about and discuss 
the role of AI in our society, representation and diversity in AI from a completely different 
perspective. The young people were able to write chatbot scripts that critiqued and 
played with the expectations we bring to a conversation with a chatbot. Writing these 
scripts gave them a voice to talk about their relationship with technology and to challenge 
the vision that adults in the tech industry present for our future relationship with AI. We 
saw this most when discussing eternal life, (not for them thanks) and through the 
irreverent humour their chatbot personas employed when discussing transhumanism 
and other techno utopian ideas. 
 
Selected quotes from the young people on the creative learning process: 
 
How would you describe learning about AI & talking to chatbots, to your friends. 
“Mind-opening and unique.” 
“This activity is a good way of learning to talk to ai.” 
“Amazing.” 
“You get to make new friends. It's fun and you learn more about what's to come in the world.” 
 
How would you describe this activity, (learning about AI & talking to chatbots), to your 
friends in two sentences? 
“Mind-opening and unique.” 
“This activity is a good way of learning to talk to ai.” 
 
291 
 
How would you describe this activity, (creating text adventures in Twine), to your friends 
in two sentences? 
“Using twine is immersive. It lets you creat your own unique story.” 
This is useful for kids who like to make story they can use their mind to make a powerful story 
that what i did.” 
“Allows creativity. No limits.” 
 
How would you describe this activity, (scripting conversations using DialogFlow), to your 
friends in two sentences? 
‘Scripting things in Dialog flow is cool, you can program your own bot.” 
 
How would you describe this activity (presenting the Future Infinite Guide at the AI in Art 
event) to your friends in two sentences? 
“Cool and exciting.” 
“This was the best camp this one you get to make a robot answer your question.” 
“Fun . Scary.” 
 
It was great to collaborate with a group of artists who have a clear and challenging artistic 
vision (the creation of the Infinite Guide artwork) with which to frame learning activities. 
Also hugely valuable to work with artists who have already invested the time to learn new 
technical skills needed to work creatively with AI & then how to make those tools 
accessible to young people. 
 
Working with B & Coral I learned new facilitation skills, particularly for engaging 
teenagers in critical dialogues around art and tech. I-DAT also introduced the use of 
interaction design methods such as ‘user experience journeys’ as a way to support young 
people to take an artistic and performative approach to the prototyping of art 
experiences. This was particularly useful to support the young people to consider the 
experience of an interactive art installation from the point of view of the viewer and to 
enable the young people to combine techniques from theatre (lighting, performance, set 
design) sculpture and digital art. 
 
B & Coral were excellent role models as women working critically with AI, they shared 
their own reflections on their role as women in a male dominated space which opened 
up a space to discuss diversity within art and the tech industry. 
 
The AI in Art event gave the young people we work with the opportunity to share a 
platform, with professional artists working with AI, to show their work and engage with 
 
292 
discussion and debate on a level with those artists. The work we did on the camp and 
after it gave the young people the experience, skills and knowledge they needed to 
present and ask questions with confidence.  
 
Quotes from the young people at the AI in Art event. 
 
Bonnie (16) at the AI in Art event. “We shouldn’t say that AI is taking away the job or 
artists and creative people because for some people AI is how they express themselves 
creatively.” 
 
Camilla Jane (12) at the AI in Art event. “We need to think about how films like the 
Teminator might come true because the AI are getting close to being smarter than us.”
