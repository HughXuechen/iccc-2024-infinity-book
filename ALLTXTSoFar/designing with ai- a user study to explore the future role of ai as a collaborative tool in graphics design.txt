1 Introduction 
In today’s evolving digital landscape Artificial intelligence (AI) has 
made significant advancements in recent years, transforming 
various industries and fields, including the field of graphic design 
[42]. According to Andrew Ng, a professor at Stanford University 
and the founder of Coursera and the Google Brain Deep Learning 
Project, “Artificial intelligence is the new electricity” [3]. AI adapts 
human skills to machines, enabling them to evolve and using these 
skills outside the human body [44]. The ability of AI to analyze and 
interpret extensive amount of data, coupled with its aptitude for 
learning and adjustment, has resulted in the emergence of novel 
tools and methodologies that are revolutionizing the creation and 
perception of graphic design [55].   
 
In the realm of graphic design, AI-powered tools have emerged as 
valuable assistants, providing designers with new capabilities and 
enhancing their workflow efficiency, the field of graphic design has 
witnessed a transformative shift with the integration of AI into 
various design processes [31]. AI-powered tools have gradually 
become indispensable, assisting designers in tasks such as 
generating ideas, enhancing productivity, and improving overall 
design quality [42].  
 
Generative AI models have the potential to automate content 
generation, increase the variety of content, and personalize content 
based on user preferences [29]. The integration of generative AI 
tools like DALL-E and MidJourney has brought a revolutionary 
shift in collaborative design processes [29]. These generative AI 
tools, driven by deep learning and latent diffusion models, tap into 
existing image databases to generate new and visually compelling 
content based on text prompts [54]. AI tools increase productivity 
and offer assistance in several areas like color selection, layout, and 
composition [42] and save time and effort [2], but they may lack 
the creativity and uniqueness of human designers [13]. AI-powered 
graphic design tools have made advancements but are constrained 
by algorithmic boundaries and originality in visuals [21,17]. 
However, regardless of the developments in AI technology, there 
remains a substantial gap between its potential and the current state 
of AI integration in graphic design [2]. To bridge the gap, this study 
investigates the perceptions and perspectives of professional 
designers regarding AI in graphic design, exploring its future 
implications. The study intends to explore the current limitations, 
requirements, and concerns of designers when it comes to AI 
integration.  
 
The research problem addresses the exploration of AI’s potential as 
a collaborative tool in graphic design. It aims to understand the 
limited adoption of AI among professional designers and seeks 
insights into their attitudes and acceptance of AI-driven 
collaboration. This research problem plays an important role in 
shaping the subsequent stages of the study and informing the 
development of solutions that cater to designers’ requirements. 
 
This article presents a literature review, existing software and its 
shortcomings, pre-study followed by prototype development, user 
sessions and interviews, and a discussion on the implications of 
findings. Through the integration of these findings, this research 
article aims to provide valuable insights into collaborative role of 
AI in design. 
1.1 Research Problem

underexplored. This research problem seeks to investigate the 
extent to which AI can be effectively employed as a collaborative 
tool for professional designers. 
1.2 Research Objective 
The objective of this study gathers designers’ insights on how they 
envision AI as a collaborative tool by developing futuristic 
scenarios and a prototype. The study aims to identify barriers, 
challenges, and opportunities for effectively integrating AI into the 
design process and enhancing collaboration between designers and 
AI systems.  
1.3 Research Questions 
RQ1. What are the perceptions and concerns of designers regarding 
the integration of AI into graphic design considering the future of 
AI-powered tools. 
 
RQ2. What are the concerns of designers regarding the ethical 
implications associated with AI in graphic design? 
2 Background 
 
2.1  Literature Review  
2.1.1 Generative AI in Graphics Design 
 
The future of graphics design is being reshaped by the integration 
of generative AI tools [54]. Generative AI refers to AI technologies 
that automatically generate visual or written content based on text 
prompts [29]. Tools like DALL-E and MidJourney play a vital role 
in supporting idea generation, idea expansion, and have gained 
popularity in graphics design due to their ability to generate 
realistic images and text by using vast amounts of internet data [54]. 
These tools offer creative professionals the opportunity to explore 
new content possibilities and expand their creative horizons. The 
concept of participatory AI is discussed, emphasizing the 
involvement of creative professionals in the design and decision-
making processes [29]. Generative AI has the potential to automate 
the generation of high-quality content, leading to increased content 
variety and personalized experiences for users [29]. However, there 
are some challenges and potential risks associated with generative 
AI [40]. When trained on a mixture of real and AI-generated data, 
generative AI tools may exhibit degraded performance, as indicated 
by simulations using an image-generation AI tool. This raises 
concerns about the degeneration of generative AI, emphasizing the 
need for further research. 
 
2.1.2 Collaboration between Humans and AI in Graphic Design: 
Opportunities and Limitations 
 
The collaboration between humans and AI in graphic design offers 
both opportunities and limitations. AI’s ability to automate certain 
design tasks can significantly reduce time-consuming work, 
allowing designers to allocate more room for the creative process 
[33]. It can serve as an assistant and complement users’ individual 
needs and capabilities, resulting in enhanced design outcomes [36]. 
However, it is crucial to recognize the limitations of AI when it 
comes to creativity and the ability to generate entirely new designs 
[42]. Despite their capabilities, machines still lack intention and 
personal goals, requiring human designers to guide and approve 
designs [47]. The integration of AI and machine learning in design 
programs requires designers to have a command of design 
principles and typography rules. AI can automate certain stages of 
the design process, but designers need to be more creative and adapt 
to technological advancements [33]. The collaboration between 
humans and AI should be approached with an understanding of 
AI’s function as a tool to help and amplify the creative abilities of 
designers because the currently available AI-powered co-creative 
tools primarily focus on idea generation and execution, with limited 
involvement in the early stages of co-creation [28]. Future tools 
should harness the unique capabilities of AI to foster a more 
collaborative and human-centred creative process and leverage 
AI’s potential in enhancing the creativity of designers [28]. One 
aspect that can be explored is the use of AI models to evaluate 
creativity based on factors such as novelty, and value, researchers 
have discussed the potential of comparing AI-based assessments 
with human judgments and employing unsupervised machine 
learning 
techniques 
to 
improve 
these 
evaluations 
[38]. 
Additionally, the importance of conceptual organization is 
highlighted as a key factor in enhancing creativity assessments 
[38]. AI can transform design by determining user preferences and 
allowing websites to adapt to changing interests. The evolving 
relationship between AI and graphic design raises important 
considerations for designers in terms of collaboration and 
adaptation 
[22]. 
Hybrid 
human-AI 
systems 
encourage 
collaboration between humans and AI, humans can provide 
guidance, domain expertise, and contextual understanding, while 
AI systems can process and analyze large datasets, identify 
patterns, and generate insights. By working together, humans and 
AI can tackle complex problems that neither could solve 
independently [41]. By further exploring and integrating these 
approaches, collaboration between humans and AI in graphic 
design can be enhanced, opening up new opportunities for more 
innovative and creative design processes. 
 
2.1.3 Impact of AI on the Graphic Design Industry: 
Productivity and Creativity 
 
The impact of AI on the graphic design industry is a topic of 
significant interest. One of the key advantages is increased 
productivity as it is seen to speed up the whole design process. 
However, there are chances that AI will impact the overall quality 
of design by potentially diminishing human creativity and resulting 
in more predictable and homogenized design [42]. AI may lack 
creativity in terms of generating entirely new designs, but it can be 
highly proficient in executing designs created by human designers 
[8, 9]. Even though AI may not possess the ability to create entirely 
new designs but it can speed up the design process by automation 
and save time for designers, meanwhile, designers can have more 
time on their hands to focus on creativity and innovation [33]. The 
focus should not be on replacing humans, but on integration of AI 
systems into design process [52].  
 
2.1.4 Responsible Integration of AI in Design Practices: 
Guidelines and Challenges 
 
 
 
 
2 
Ensuring the responsible integration of AI in design practices 
requires the development and adherence to ethical guidelines. 
Organizations and practitioners are faced with the challenge of 
aligning ethical considerations with technological advancements. 
Early adopters of AI have focused on innovation, positioning 
themselves for growth and increased employment opportunities [7]. 
However, it is crucial to navigate these advancements with a deep 
understanding 
of 
ethical 
principles 
and 
considerations. 
Additionally, integrating ethical behavior into AI through the 
incorporation of pedagogy, moral psychology development, and 
computer science has been proposed as one approach [53]. Further 
research and collaboration are needed to establish guidelines and 
address the complex ethical challenges that arise in the integration 
of AI in design practices. 
 
2.1.5 Ethical Considerations in the Integration of AI into 
Creative Processes 
 
The integration of AI into creative processes has raised significant 
ethical considerations and fairness implications. This becomes 
particularly relevant when autonomous systems design themselves, 
learn, and improve over time [18]. To address potential 
discrimination and promote equitable outcomes, the concept of fair 
AI 
has 
emerged 
[23]. 
However, 
navigating 
ethical 
recommendations alongside technological advancements in AI 
poses a complex task [53]. One proposed approach is to integrate 
ethical behaviour into AI by incorporating pedagogy, moral 
psychology development, and computer science [53]. Moreover, 
the application of a feminist perspective in AI ethics offers valuable 
insights into ethical theories, real-world implications, power 
dynamics, and contextual factors [50]. Such perspectives 
emphasize self-evaluation and addressing blind spots, providing a 
roadmap for policymakers and practitioners working on the 
responsible integration of AI into creative processes. 
 
The literature review provides insights into the current state of AI 
in design. It emphasizes the importance of addressing ethical 
considerations, impact of AI and generative AI on the graphic 
design industry.  
 
2.2  Overview of Some Existing AI Software in 
Graphic Design 
 
This section provides an overview of some of the AI-powered tools, 
these selections serve as a solid groundwork for the study at hand, 
providing valuable insights into the current landscape of graphic 
design software and identifying areas that require further 
exploration. 
 
Text to image generation tools 
DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion are three leading text 
image generation tools, they employ generative models like 
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational 
Autoencoders (VAEs). These models have brought together the 
domains of Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language 
Processing (NLP), enabling the creation of images based on textual 
descriptions. DALL·E 2 excels in generating human images, 
Midjourney, on the other hand, produces images with rich colors 
and a high degree of realism across various attempts. This suggests 
that the model can capture and incorporate detailed visual attributes 
into its generated images. In contrast, Stable Diffusion stands out 
due to its open-source nature and the resulting support from a large 
community [46].  
 
Looka (logo maker) 
Looka, formerly known as Logojoy, is a logo maker website 
founded in 2016. It has assisted over 20 million users across 188 
countries, generating 10 billion custom logos [35]. With the help of 
Looka logo designing is just few clicks away but it’s a common 
perception about Looka, that the logos generated by Looka often 
lack essential qualities for successful brandings, such as creativity, 
simplicity, timelessness, and originality. Implementing AI or 
machine learning may not match the creativity level of a trained 
graphic designer [33]. 
 
Canva 
Canva is an online design and visual communication platform 
launched in 2013. It aims to enable users worldwide to create 
diverse designs and share them across various mediums [9]. Canva 
provides photo-editing tools, including a design grid, free icons, 
stickers, badges, and an interactive color wheel for creating and 
exploring color schemes [25]. However, some users find limitations 
in editing designs, as they may not be very flexible and 
accommodating, sometimes resulting in universal designs [14]. In 
2019 Canva experienced a huge data breach, but efforts have been 
made to address the issue [25]. 
 
Adobe  
Adobes Generative AI tools, Adobe Sensei that uses Adobe's 
artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, designed to 
enhance and automate various creative and marketing tasks [1], 
another Generative AI tool, Adobe Firefly, that is designed to 
generate images that are safe to use in commercial settings, 
leveraging licensed images from Adobe Stock and open-source 
content. This demonstrates the implementation of AI-generated 
content in a professional context [1]. Adobe Sensei automates 
tasks, improves editing capabilities, streamlines design workflows, 
and provides intelligent recommendations. Machine learning 
algorithms enable features like content-aware fills, image auto-
tagging, and automatic color and font suggestions. Adobe Sensei 
enhances productivity, but the level of creativity in design 
ultimately depends on the skills of the designer [33].  
 
Microsoft's Designer Tool 
Microsoft's Designer tool uses artificial intelligence, specifically 
the DALL-E 2 model, to create images based on text descriptions. 
By entering a few words or a sentence, users can generate an image 
that matches their description. This highlights the ability of AI to 
turn textual input into visual output and supports the feasibility of 
AI-powered design tools [14].

3 Methodology  
This research process employed Research Through Design (RtD), 
this approach refers to the integration of research and design 
activities to create new knowledge, RtD involves using design 
methods and approaches to generate insights, explore possibilities, 
and create tangible artifacts or prototypes that contribute to the 
research process. [51]. Through design thinking principles [12], the 
research process embraced a human-centered and iterative 
approach. Research started with a preliminary study to understand 
the AI tools landscape in design, creating scenarios for exploring 
innovative design alternatives, developing a prototype using 
speculative design, and conducting user study and interviews.  This 
research process allowed to gain a deep understanding of AI 
integration in design and addressed the research questions 
effectively. 
3.1  Pre-Study 
The preliminary study aimed to gather initial insights into the 
problem domain and understand the existing landscape of AI tools 
in design [27], and to explore the perspectives of professional 
graphic designers, a survey was designed to assess their 
preferences, attitudes, and opinions regarding AI tools [26]. The 
survey questions were carefully crafted to gather data on the 
participants’ backgrounds, qualifications, and alignment with the 
research topic. It also included questions related to their usage of 
AI, the frequency of AI tool adoption, the current challenges faced, 
and their future expectations about AI tools in graphic design.  
 
Before administering the survey to a larger group, a pilot test was 
conducted with a small group of designers. The pilot test helped 
identify any issues with the survey design, such as confusing or 
leading questions, and allowed for necessary adjustments to ensure 
the reliability and validity of the survey instrument [39]. The 
feedback received from the pilot participants played a crucial role 
in refining the survey questionnaire and ensuring its effectiveness 
in gathering meaningful insights from the larger sample.  
 
A call for participation was posted on LinkedIn, where professional 
designers were requested to fill out the survey. A total of 11 
responses were gathered from graphic designers, UX designers, and 
creative directors who participated in the survey. The results of the 
survey provided valuable insights into the current use of AI in 
graphic design, its challenges, and future expectations. To visualize 
the results gathered from the survey, personas were created, 
personas are fictional characters that represent a group of users, 
their goals and characteristics and useful personas represent users’ 
wants needs, and motivations [39]. Personas help better understand 
the problem and serve as foundation for subsequent research steps.   
 
3.2  Design Exploration 
This phase involved envisioning the future of design with 
advanced AI capabilities and acknowledging the current gaps in 
the design field and the potential of AI. A speculative design 
approach was employed that involved designing future products 
and services not through prediction [37, 20] but by prototyping 
and exploring the social, cultural, and ethical implications of 
emerging technologies [43]. Motivated by the needs of designers 
identified through survey results, three scenarios were developed: 
collaboration, evaluation, and automation. These scenarios were 
designed and structured conceptual systems that represented 
equally plausible future contexts [49]. This approach helped to 
consider the broader implications and benefits of advanced AI in 
collaboration, evaluation, and automation scenarios within the 
design domain. Each scenario offered a distinct perspective on 
how designers would interact with advanced AI technologies in a 
highly advanced and established design context. To further 
explore these scenarios and provoke discussions, an interactive 
prototype called Desain was created using Figma. This prototype 
served as a tool for provocation and exploration, encouraging 
people to imagine and discuss potential future scenarios [48]. 
Figure 1 shows a basic sketch developed to visualize scenarios 
and the prototype. 
 
 
Figure 1: Initial sketch of visualising scenarios and prototype  
 
3.3  Design Provocation 
This phase involves exploration of prototype through research 
study with designers, user studies were conducted with designers 
in order to gain insights about experience, perspective, and 
integration of AI in the design process. The study followed a 
prototype-driven inquiry approach, where the prototype is used to 
explore and gather feedback, this involved conducting investigative 
work and exploring new possibilities to gain valuable insights and 
enhance understanding [45].  
The study began with recruitment, enlisting 12 participants from 
various design agencies in Sweden, including graphic designers, 
UX designers, and creative directors. Participants were identified 
through LinkedIn, and initial contact was made by sending them 
personalized emails explaining the study and inviting them to 
participate. Upon confirmation of their interest and availability, 
suitable times for user sessions and interviews were scheduled. The 
participants had varying levels of experience in the design field, 
ranging from 2 to 20 years. 
 
3.3.1 Study Setup 
 
Following the recruitment phase, user studies were conducted with 
participants, where participants had the opportunity to attend the 
session face-to-face in person or remotely through Zoom, Face-
 
 
 
4 
moderated sessions involve the researcher and users sitting in the 
same room, interacting with each other. In contrast, remote 
moderated sessions occur when the researcher and user are in 
different places but interact through screen-sharing technology 
[39]. 
The first user session began with a total of six participants, four of 
whom attended in-person sessions, and the remaining two 
participants participated via Zoom. Each session lasted for 40-45 
minutes.  This format allowed for flexibility and ensured broader 
participation.  The session started with a brief about the research 
and then the participants were introduced to the prototype, Desain, 
which served as a catalyst for driving inquiry and stimulating 
discussions. The prototype was thoroughly reviewed, enabling the 
participants to interact with it. After participants explored the 
prototype, semi-structured interviews were conducted, with pre-
established questions but the order was changed according to the 
participants’ responses [6]. The interview questions covered 
various aspects, such as the participants’ overall experience with 
the prototype, their feedback on its design and functionality, and 
their past experiences with AI in their design practice. Through 
these interviews, participants had the opportunity to reflect on their 
own experiences, express their insights, voice concerns, and 
highlight potential opportunities related to AI in design.  
 
For the second iteration, six new participants were recruited, 
introducing a better version of the prototype to enrich the research 
findings. In the final iteration, all 12 participants were sent the 
prototype via email to gather final feedback. This step allowed for 
additional insights to emerge after the group discussion, validating 
the findings and refining the prototype if needed. 
 
The research study progressed through three iterations of 
prototypes, each involving a different set of participants. Insights 
were gathered from participants and were incorporated into the 
prototype. Overall, the structured progression with iterative 
prototyping, combined with user study and interviews, aimed to 
provoke thoughtful discussions and gather valuable insights into 
the potential implications of AI in the design field. 
3.4  Data Analysis 
Thematic analysis was employed to systematically identify, 
organize, and offer insight into patterns of meaning known as 
themes within the qualitative data collected from user sessions and 
interviews [5]. To facilitate the analysis process, Mural software 
was used. First step toward analysis was transcription of data 
gathered from users’ sessions and interviews. This involved 
carefully listening to the audio recordings and converting the 
spoken words into written form. Transcribing the data ensured the 
comprehensiveness and accuracy of participants’ feedback and 
insights.  
 
Next, transcribed data was imported into Mural, data was organized 
into meaningful segments. Within Mural, coding techniques were 
applied to identify patterns and themes within the data. Data were 
categorized into codes, which facilitated the organization and 
further analysis of the data. Sub-themes and overarching themes 
were identified that emerged from the coded data. According to 
Braun and Clarke, codes are a building block of analysis, and a 
theme captures something important from data about research 
questions [4].  Once the code, sub-themes, and themes were 
identified, findings were summarised. This involved synthesizing 
the data and presenting the key insights and patterns that emerged 
from the thematic analysis. Important quotes were highlighted as 
examples to support the identified themes, providing a rich and 
meaningful understanding of participants’ perspectives and 
experiences.  
 
3.5  Method Critique 
One of the limitations of the study was that the prototype used for 
the research did not have any AI functionality. This could have 
influenced the findings as participants were not interacting with a 
fully functional AI tool. The lack of AI functionality in the 
prototype may have limited participants’ ability to provide accurate 
feedback and insights on the potential benefits and challenges of 
using AI in design.  
4 Design Outcome 
This chapter describes the prototype used as a design provocation 
in this study. The purpose of this prototype was to stimulate debate 
and gather thoughts from the audience about the future role of AI 
in design. The prototype showcased advanced functionalities to 
gauge perceptions and reactions. It should be noted that the 
prototype did not incorporate actual AI functionality but was 
designed to spark discussions and reflections on the potential 
impact of highly developed AI in design. The proposed 
functionalities were motivated by the scenarios which were based 
on the insights gathered from pre-study and existing AI tools.  
4.1  Desain Prototype Description  
During the prototype phase, a high-fidelity interactive prototype 
named Desain was created using Figma. The prototype aimed to 
provide an engaging and interactive experience for users to shape a 
successful solution and enhance their understanding Desain 
combined design and AI potential capabilities to support designers 
in their creative process. The prototype featured a clean and 
intuitive user interface with a color scheme consisting of white, teal 
blue, and yellow accents to highlight important elements. The 
Desain logo was designed in hand-written lettering to add a 
personal touch and create an organic and humanistic feel. 
 
4.2  Design Motivation 
The motivation behind Desain was to create advanced AI design 
tools that address the limitation of existing tools and empower 
professional designers to have their creative input. The pre-study 
revealed the needs, pain points, hopes, and concerns of designers, 
which served as a foundation for defining the functionalities of 
Desain. The aim was to develop a tool that goes beyond the

capabilities of current AI tools and allows designers to express their 
creativity. By incorporating evaluation, collaboration, and 
automation functionalities, Desain sought to enhance the design 
experience and provide designers with the tools they need to excel 
in their creative endeavors. 
Desain encompasses three main functions aimed at enhancing the 
design experience: 
 
4.2.1 Evaluation Function  
Desain's evaluation function empowered designers to assess their 
work and gather valuable feedback. Users could upload their 
designs or share online links for evaluation. Desain provides 
designers with visual and written feedback on various aspects of 
their work, including design quality, usability, accessibility, and 
sustainability. This comprehensive evaluation capability filled a 
gap in existing design tools, providing designers with critical 
insights to improve their work.  
Figure 2 shows the main page of Evaluate function, and Figure 
3shows how this function will provide evaluation written feedback 
as well as visual feedback. 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2: Evaluation Function  
 
Figure 3: Evaluation Function Results 
4.2.2 Collaboration Function 
The collaboration function in Desain facilitated collaborative 
design processes by allowing designers to provide and receive 
creative direction. Designers can provide written feedback, express 
their ideas, and attach design files such as logos or rough sketches 
to provide visual references and this tool creates a visual output of 
written input. Within this function, designers could write prompts 
or freely express their ideas. They had the option to attach design 
files, such as logos or rough sketches, to provide visual references. 
Real-time collaboration allows designers to view and edit designs 
within the tool itself. Additionally, designers can download their 
designs in multiple formats and easily share them with 
stakeholders, promoting seamless collaboration and effective 
communication. Figure 4 shows the main page of the Collaboration 
function and Figure 5 shows the prompt to input direction and the 
results produced from it.

Figure 5: Subpages of Collaboration Function  
 
4.2.3 Automation Function 
Desain's automation function enabled designers to automate 
routine, mundane, and time-consuming design tasks, freeing up 
their time for more creative aspects of their work. Designers 
provide a base design and specify desired automation parameters, 
such as color schemes or layout variations. its versatile automation 
capabilities allowed designers to generate various design outputs 
 
 
 
6 
based on their specific requirements. For example, automation of 
the generation of different color palettes, layout options, or 
typography choices. By automating these tasks, Desain aims to free 
up designers' time and enable them to focus on more creative 
aspects of their work.  
Figure 6 shows the main page of the Automation function and 
Figure 7 provides simulation of the results produced. 
 
 
 
Figure 6: Automation Function 
 
 
 
Figure 7: Subpages of Automation  
 
The proposed AI functionalities in Desain align with existing 
literature and research in the field. There is a wide range of AI 
systems and functionalities that have been successfully 
implemented using existing technologies. Research studies have 
explored the use of AI as image generators, providing visual stimuli 
for designers to draw inspiration from [11,10, 19,30,34].  
Facilitators, such as Adobe Sensei, have also been developed as AI 
systems to streamline and simplify design actions. [1]. AI-concept 
evaluators can analyze and rank design proposals based on novelty 
and level of detail [8]. By leveraging advanced AI technologies 
such as Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing 
(NLP), and generative models, CV allows computers to interpret 
and comprehend visual data extracted from images and videos  
[32], whereas NLP along with Machine learning mimics human 
behavior and creates interesting and creative solutions [16].  
suggested capabilities can be realistically achieved within the 
boundaries of current technological advancements.  
 
5 Findings  
 
The thematic analysis conducted in this design research involved 
the examination of collected data from user study and post-user 
study interviews. Throughout the research process, a multitude of 
ideas and concepts were generated, focusing on the potential role 
of AI in graphic design.  
These findings were carefully analyzed to provide valuable data 
contributing to addressing the research question. “How do graphic 
designers perceive the role of AI as a collaborative tool in their 
design process?” The aim was to gain a comprehensive 
understanding of how AI is perceived and experienced by graphic 
designers, shedding light on its impact, challenges, and potential 
benefits in facilitating collaboration. 
Additionally, an exploration was undertaken to understand “the 
perspectives of designers regarding the ethical concerns associated 
with AI in graphic design”. By delving into their viewpoints, this 
investigation aimed to uncover the ethical considerations raised by 
the integration of AI in the field of graphic design, providing 
insights into the designers’ attitudes, concerns, and considerations 
surrounding these issues.  
 
 
5.1  Positive Perception of AI as a design tool 
 
When participants were asked if such a tool to exist (Desain) will 
they use it or not? One participant expressed, “I would see it as a 
tool, like something that will help me become more effective in my 
work. So, I would be generally positive about it because I see the 
potential.” This participant views AI as a means to enhance their 
effectiveness and productivity in their design work, emphasizing 
the potential benefits it can bring.
