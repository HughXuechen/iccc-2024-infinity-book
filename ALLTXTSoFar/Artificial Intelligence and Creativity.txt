Preface 
From artists’ and technologists’ perspective this book examines deﬁnitions and 
understandings of creativity that support cross-disciplinary work that impacts society. 
The gap between creative human processes, technology, and science is the focus of 
the book which highlights how the impact of new technologies and systems changes 
the world in which we live. Directly drawing from technologists’ and artists’ expe-
riences it asks what are the environments in which creativity can survive and grow? 
The parameters which deﬁne such environments are examined. 
The shift toward an increasing use of virtual and synthetic worlds in society 
enables the role of technology in the creative process to be critically assessed. The 
various ways in which technology may be utilized in the creative process are exam-
ined, including technology as computation, synthesizer, interactor, integrator, and as 
automaton. The key aspects of the digital revolution that most affect creativity and 
society are explored and evaluated. 
Creative processes that involve technology can offer opportunities to investigate 
the philosophical gap between the subjective and objective relationships that exist 
between people, places, and things. What are the components in these relationships 
that enhance creativity? The use of digital images in painting provides a case study 
on image and representation. How has the narrative on the image been affected by 
technology? Do we see ourselves differently as a result of this? 
Social and cultural systems that appear to be more successful at applying repetitive 
processes are challenged. These systems are compared to internationally recognized 
sculptural artworks that involve repetition. The underlying logic of such systems 
is investigated and analyzed, particularly in their relationship to wider society. 
How can creativity contribute to an understanding of biomimetic processes that 
emulate models and systems of nature that can be harnessed to solve complex human 
problems? 
The book evidences the changing borders between art and science and demon-
strates how inter-subject collaboration and shared authorship is essential in interdis-
ciplinary and cross-disciplinary projects. 
Chapters 2–5 take an artist’s perspective of creativity as a slippery concept that can 
be described as an ability to create something from nothing. In the pre-enlightenment
vii

Preface
period creativity was associated with a divine power; during the enlightenment it was 
considered a collective power, whereas in recently times it is connected to the notion 
of the artist as an individual genius. This section investigates how the foundations 
of artistic and scientiﬁc research have been developed to create new frameworks for 
creativity, knowledge production, and collaboration. It provides some case studies 
to demonstrate how artistic thinking has been assisted by technological develop-
ments and asks what stages are involved in the creative process and how they may be 
harnessed within and beyond the art world. It demonstrates why creativity is recog-
nized as being an important individual trait within a collective endeavor which is 
important in a drive for entrepreneurship and innovation. Creativity can also have a 
communal aspect when the interworking of a group inspires individuals to generate 
new ideas and perspectives when working collaboratively. 
Chapters 6 and 7 take a technological perspective of creativity to evidence the 
progress of computing and digital media as a relevant and useful case study. It 
asks which visions of the future in the early days of computing have stood the 
test of time, and which have vanished without trace? Can this be used as guide 
for current and future areas of research and development? If one Internet year is 
equivalent to seven calendar years, are virtual worlds being utilized as an effective 
accelerator for these new ideas and their implementation and evaluation? The nature 
of digital media and its constituent parts such as electronic devices, sensors, images, 
audio, games, web pages, social media, e-books, and Internet of Things provides 
a diverse environment which can be viewed as a test bed for current and future 
ideas. Individual disciplines utilize virtual worlds in different ways. As collaboration 
is often involved in such research environments, does the technology make these 
collaborations effective? Have the limits of disciplinary approaches been reached? 
The importance of interdisciplinary collaborations for the future is proposed and 
evaluated. The current enablers for progressing interdisciplinary collaborations are 
presented. 
Chapters 8 and 9 explore the philosophical concerns of time, temporality, and 
repeated action within creativity in the arts and science. Drawing distinctions between 
art thinking and design thinking could support new cultural ecologies, capable of 
critical revaluations of our social, professional, and relational hierarchies. The focus 
is on understanding artists’ processes, to see whether creativity can be recognized 
and nurtured across all ﬁelds and industries. By identifying creative authorship as 
an integral part of life, we also highlight everyone’s singular responsibility toward 
creating the cultural ecologies that shape society as it navigates the Fourth Industrial 
Revolution. 
Chapters 10–12 explore how art can help science and technology, and how to 
obtain resources and collaborations for further research and development in the ﬁeld 
of creativity? Finally, an epilog draws together the outstanding principles and current 
issues in a set of propositions. 
Where the references are to online papers and documents, the authors have endeav-
ored to provide those that are open source and in the public domain rather than behind 
a paywall. The current move to a requirement for open-source publication in Europe 
will assist this situation in the future (on the basis that the tax-payer has already

contributed to the funding of research and development and therefore should be 
entitled to read the publications without further charge). Where publications are 
currently behind a paywall, readers can normally only read the abstract and see the 
list of references before deciding whether to purchase the paper. 
There are many references to online sources on the Internet. Readers of the e-book 
can access these directly as they are embedded in the text as hot links. Some URLs 
of web pages change over time due to site names being changed by their owners, or 
the position of the website in the site hierarchy being altered. Where the link does 
not access the required page, the correct page can often be located by putting the 
URL into Google. If this doesn’t work due to Google’s cached copy of the original 
website having been over-written, then the title of the reference can be typed into 
Google. 
This volume is published as a Springer Open Access book in order to make the e-
book freely available to everyone for study and further research, particularly students 
who may be least able to afford the normal cost of a book. There is a nominal charge 
for the printed book to cover the cost of printing. 
Permissions to include the images used in the ﬁgures have been obtained. If there 
have been any errors or omissions the authors would be pleased to rectify these at 
the earliest opportunity. 
It is hoped that this book makes a useful contribution to an important area of 
signiﬁcant ongoing research, development, and application.

Chapter 1 
Introduction 
Rae Earnshaw 
Abstract Human creators are capable of great feats of imagination and inventive-
ness. History and tradition testify to the masterpieces that have been produced over 
the centuries. Most of these have been created in human time with the tools that were 
available. The current digital revolution is providing a new set of tools and environ-
ments that creators can use, but this does raise issues such as to how best to preserve 
traditions and esthetic values that have been built up over many generations. Tech-
nology can provide both continuity and discontinuity which has both opportunities 
and challenges. A number of the factors inﬂuencing creativity are summarized, and 
suggestions made for evaluating the outcomes of the creative process. Mixed inter-
disciplinary environments offer opportunities for the production of creative works. 
The rise of commercial art for the Internet and interactive gaming is noted.

1.1 Traditional Understandings of Creativity 
Oxford Languages [1] deﬁnes creativity as—“the use of imagination or original 
ideas to create something; inventiveness”. 
The use of imagination, or original ideas, are assumed in this deﬁnition to be 
by a human creator. Normally what is created involves some kind of tool (e.g., 
paintbrush, chisel) or process (which may involve other components such as objects 
or materials) to produce the outcome. It is also assumed that the use of this tool or 
process is under the direct, or indirect, control of the human. This may involve the 
need to reﬁne the use of the tool or process as the outcome is being generated, or even 
change the tool or process. This produces some kind of iteration between the content 
creator and the outcome. This reﬁnement assumes that the human creator is learning 
something new during the process of creation and is feeding back into the creative 
process appropriate changes to the original intentions which result in changes to 
the outcome. This process is happening in real-time, but it is also human-time and 
proceeds at an appropriate pace for the human creator. This may take days, weeks, 
months, or even years.

1.2 Creativity and Technology 
Direct generation of an outcome may be assumed to be under the control of the creator, 
with the latter being directly involved in any iterative processes that may be required. 
Indirect generation may involve the use of an amanuensis or other form of support 
and assistance. The instructions of the original creator may be formalized into a script 
with intentions and objectives. This could be implemented by mechanical means, or 
it may be converted into a form to be used by a computer. This could be an algorithm, 
a virtual environment, or instructions for generating an image, animation, game, or 
artifact (e.g., by the stereolithography process). This may change the real-time, and 
human-time, process substantially. For example, the mis-match between human time 
and computer time is a well-known discontinuity [2]. Human thoughts are typically 
0.5 s—this is the time for information from the external world to be incorporated 
into human conscious experience [3]. By contrast, a 2 GHz chip in a computer can 
operate at 2 billion operations per sec. In addition, there is a further discontinuity 
between human time and Internet time. The industry states that one Internet year is 
equivalent to seven calendar years [4]. This implies that in an Internet context, events 
can happen much faster than in the real world. These mis-matches can be a barrier 
and obstacle in some contexts and a liberator and enabler in others. 
In addition, computers also change and develop as new algorithms are produced 
to meet what are perceived to be current needs. Artiﬁcial intelligence is one of these 
developments. A process that is initially described in well-deﬁned terms may be 
allowed to receive direct information from the process or environment on which 
it is working, and change the process to maximize its chances of achieving the 
particular outcomes that are required. This can introduce a degree of uncertainty and 
unpredictability into the creative process, but it may lead to new outcomes and greater 
efﬁciency and effectiveness. It also raises the question of whether the creative process 
should be essentially deterministic or allowed to contain elements of randomness. 
Therefore, the boundary between the solo production of creative works and 
assisted production is not always a deﬁnitive one. It is not a simple either/or situation. 
When a painter uses a brush it is an augmentation of the human’s natural capabilities. 
Similarly, the artistic process may be assisted by many different kinds of augmenta-
tion, some deterministic and others random. Such tools, facilities, and environments 
change and develop over time. 
1.3 Creativity and Context 
In addition, creativity does not exist in a vacuum. Gombrich [5] has shown that 
painters, sculptors and architects are inﬂuenced by a wide variety of factors beyond 
their own ideas and creativity, including the following:
• The context in which they produce their works
• The social and cultural factors in operation in society at the time
1
Introduction
3
• The traditions and works of artists who have preceded them
• The current trends in the created works of their contemporaries
• The availability at the time of tools, materials, processes, and environments. 
Therefore, what is being revealed by a particular created work, outcome, or 
process, is not something that can be fully understood or appreciated in isolation 
from other works or from society in general. It is part of a wider story of creativity 
over time, and needs to be seen as part of that story. 
Many other deﬁnitions of creativity may be given [6]. For example, in assessing 
an individual’s creative ability, Torrance described this as 
a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deﬁciencies, gaps in knowledge, missing 
elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difﬁculty; searching for solutions, 
making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deﬁciencies: testing and retesting 
these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and ﬁnally communicating the 
results [7] 
It can be seen that this can have immediate practical implications. Any company 
that can devise a mechanism to improve the creativity of its workforce may be able to 
gain an edge on the competition and produce more appropriate products and services 
for its customers, and also in a more timely way. Such outcomes may also be at lower 
cost because of greater efﬁciency and effectiveness in the processes used. 
1.4 Creativity—A Deﬁnition 
For the purposes of this present volume, creativity may be deﬁned as including one 
or more of the following aspects: 
1. Produce something new 
2. Produce new perspectives 
3. Produce new understandings 
4. Transform the current situation into a new situation. 
1.5 Creativity in Mixed Interdisciplinary Environments 
Following the Scientiﬁc and Industrial Revolutions in the 16th to the nineteenth 
centuries there has been signiﬁcant impact on areas outside the immediate disciplines 
of science and technology. In particular, society has changed as products and services 
became more widely available. It has also impacted on the arts and humanities 
by providing new avenues for creativity and exploration. New tools have become 
available, particularly in the utilization of computers. It has been argued that the 
rise of computer technology and the Internet constitute in essence third and fourth 
revolutions, as their effects are so widespread, and also ongoing [8]. As this is part 
of present experience its long-term effects may not be easy to evaluate or predict.

R. Earnshaw
Technology can provide continuity by making traditional methods and techniques 
more efﬁcient and effective. In this sense it need not be regarded as an intrusion into 
traditional practices, but rather adding value to the status quo. It can also provide 
discontinuity by opening up new perspectives, paradigms, and dimensions of inter-
action with the observer. This may be regarded as potentially a disruptive force, but 
it can produce a greater understanding and appreciation of artistic processes and how 
they are implemented in practice. Utilization of technology can provide an oppor-
tunity to reﬂect on the more manual approaches that preceded it, and the need to 
preserve the vital and important components from earlier generations. 
1.6 Benchmarking the Outcomes of the Creative Process 
How then may we value and measure the various outcomes of the creative processes— 
to determine whether particular tools and environments are meaningful and useful 
or not? This is a difﬁcult exercise because a degree of subjectivity is involved. In 
addition, much of current digital content is created to directly serve commercial 
interests rather than esthetic or philosophical ones. More information is required 
about the value systems associated with such creative works. 
Smith [9] argues that in creating and using digital content, corporations can 
reﬂect back to society solely what it wants to see, and which can generate further 
revenue rather than involve any esthetic values or considerations. What is created 
and presented is simply a mirror to engage society in its own interests. It has become 
a commercial exercise. In addition, when considered against the four aspects of 
creativity proposed earlier, it is unlikely that any of them are satisﬁed. This could 
imply it is not genuine creativity in the great traditions of art and design. 
The meaning of the Metaverse, Mark Zuckerberg’s virtual realm, has been ridiculed for its 
dismal aesthetics – but we have got the online world we deserve [9] 
1.7 Cultural and Societal Implications 
The relationship of creativity with society is increasingly complex. As societies move 
from monocultural to multicultural there is a wider variety of histories, traditions, 
and perceptions which are involved. 
An Example—Leonardo da Vinci 
Artists such as Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) were involved with the creation of 
artistic works and also novel inventions that could have been intended to serve a 
purpose in the natural world. Both may be seen as aspects of creativity; the former 
concerned with art and the latter with prototype designs, one of which was a device 
for a ﬂying machine. However, the principles of ﬂight were not fully understood until 
400 years later, at least sufﬁciently well to be enable an airplane to be constructed

that could ﬂy successfully. This suggests that there was some kind of insight involved 
in the creation of this work. 
It could be argued that this is just evidence that he was a polymath who was gifted 
in eye and hand in numerous different areas [10]. However, an alternative view is 
that they were all products of his creative genius which transcended the discipline 
barriers that later came to be erected to preserve the various subject areas. This in 
turn led to tension between the arts and the sciences, and misrepresentation [11] 
which still continues today to some degree - due principally to disciplinary forms 
of education. In other words, da Vinci’s created works can be seen as a continuum 
which produced new perspectives and new understandings rather than just discrete 
images and objects to be viewed in isolation (Figs. 1.1 and 1.2).

1.8 Challenges and Opportunities 
The digital revolution may be regarded as intrusion into traditional art practice. 
However, it can also be an opportunity. For example, it can widen the appeal and the 
audiences for art and design. Digital technology can also support new dimensions of 
content—both static and interactive. 
Hockney used an iPad to create art works using a brush application created as 
a software app [12, 13], and submits that technology has transformed his practice. 
A number of these art works have been exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in 
London [14, 15]. However, this does raise the question of how a ‘digital brush’ may 
be compared with the traditional paint brush used by painters down the centuries. 
Clearly, it has some augmented capabilities and can be changed to produced different 
effects. Yet it is still a tool, and the artist is free to use it in any way they wish. 
Virtual environments are also being used to create digital content both to view 
and interact with [16].

1.9 Previous Work 
An earlier Open Access volume [17] explored emerging aspects of the relationship 
between artists (and other creatives) and their created works, and also how a variety 
of tools and environments have facilitated and extended these processes. Such tools 
encompass computer technology, computer environments, and interactive devices, 
for a range of information sources and application domains. They also provide new 
kinds of created works which are able to be viewed, explored, and interacted with, 
either as an installation or via a virtual environment such as the Internet. This intro-
duces new dimensions of understanding and experience for both artist and the public’s 
relationships with the works that are produced. This has raised a variety of interdis-
ciplinary opportunities and issues. From Leonardo da Vinci to David Hockney the 
opportunities for artistic and creative expression have transformed the worlds of 
information of which they are an integral part. 
1.10 Conclusion 
This present volume continues the analysis and exposition on the themes of art, 
design and technology, concentrating particularly on creativity.

Creativity and the Arts: Traditional 
and New Media 
Susan Liggett 
Abstract There are numerous theories of creativity from different academic ﬁelds, 
but an overarching unifying theory is almost impossible. Such theories may be 
speciﬁc to a particular context, or they attempt to generalize, with differences in 
particular disciplines. For example, in psychology the focus is on a micro level with 
the study of individuals; whereas in the ﬁeld of innovation research it is on a macro 
level and often disregards the individual by focusing more on the context. Creativity 
on a micro level is examined through revealing the process of an individual artist. It 
introduces ‘material thinking’; an intellectual pursuit speciﬁc to the making process 
and reﬂects on what may be learned from the process of making art. Art can create 
knowledge that constructs environments and changes lives. This personal knowl-
edge and the work of the hand is sometimes at odds with the technological world, 
but a study of artistic practices enables us to see and think differently. Artworks have 
impact beyond the esthetic to inﬂuence social, political, and economic spheres.

2.1 
Introduction 
The Encyclopaedia of Creativity (2011) suggests that theories either become domain 
speciﬁc or ﬁnd a general approach to deal with domain-based differences [1]. ‘Mate-
rial thinking’ is an intellectual pursuit particular to the making process described by 
Carter (2005) [2] and it asks, “what can be learnt from making artworks?” [2]. It 
references the work of sociologist Sennett [3] and anthropologist Ingold [4], 
The paintings of artist/academic Susan Liggett are presented as a case study to 
illustrate ‘thinking through making’ and ‘knowing from ‘being’ that can look ‘both 
inside and outside the ﬁeld of enquiry at the same time’ (ibid). This mode of thinking 
involves problem ﬁnding that is implicit in the making process, that can be more 
generative than purely focusing on problem solving. 
Craft skills and traditional art practices teach us something that enhances under-
standing that help develop our digital world, without generating nostalgia for obsolete 
practices. The artist bridges micro and macro creativity to focus both on the indi-
vidual and the context in which the artwork is made and consumed by audiences.

New technology has assisted art practice in challenging its purpose repeatedly over 
history to make it an important epistemic study. 
2.2 
Creativity and Its Products 
Creativity manifests itself in objects; as Virginia Woolf said, “Intellectual freedom 
depends upon material things” [5]. Artists and scientists are interested in analyzing 
materials. Beyond the useful scientiﬁc analysis of materials to develop products, there 
is another form of analysis of the characteristics of matter that are more difﬁcult to 
measure, such as how the color or form of an object makes us feel. Artifacts and 
artworks play a key role in how we understand the world. 
The academic study of ‘material thinking’ has been critical in helping artists 
articulate how art practices embody new understandings about individuals and their 
cultures through the process of making [2]. The importance of Carter’s work lies in 
the cognizance that some art forms exist ‘in advance of language’ and thus requires 
‘translation’ into language’ (ibid). This is the language of creativity that remains 
elusive, but is explored through practice based artistic research. 
2.3 
Creativity, Technology, Craft and Skill 
In the technological age there is concern that craft skills are becoming obsolete in 
a drive for productivity. An ability to learn a craft skill through purposeful practice, 
such as throwing a pot, is often regarded an inferior form of knowledge compared 
to learning theories and methods from literature. Contemporary sociologist Sennett 
[3] is an advocate for creative thinking, and rather than considering craft skills in 
opposition to digital technologies, he thinks of the digital as a new form of crafts-
manship. He says that the digital era is not one that should put behind it the traditions 
of craft; observing that computer coders learn through play and repetition in the same 
way as a musician learning an instrument [3]. He believes that to make good use of 
technology, one has to think like a craftsman. In his analysis of what qualities make 
a good nurse he says 
as with Linux programmers, nursing craft negotiates a liminal zone between problem solving 
and problem ﬁnding; listening to old men’s chatter, the nurse can glean clues about their 
ailments that might escape a diagnostic checklist (ibid). 
Against the backdrop of accelerating technology in the 1930s, philosophers Martin 
Heidegger (1889–1976) and Walter Benjamin (1892–1940) had a concern for tradi-
tion and hand skills in relation to technology and art. They both acknowledged 
technology’s great potential, but also that its roles had not been fully explored at the
2
Creativity and the Arts: Traditional and New Media
11
time, and there could be potential negative consequences. They endorsed an alter-
native to technology in creative thinking through writing about what can be learnt 
from art [6, 7]. 
2.4 
Thinking and Making 
Anthropologist Tim Ingold (b.1948) draws the distinctions made between theorists 
and craftsmen; saying theorists make through thinking while craftsmen think through 
making. His view is that the way we think of making is wrongheaded; as a project 
that starts with an idea, ﬁnds an appropriate material to work with, then ends when 
this material has taken on its intended form. When creating artworks there is not 
always an intended idea, it is a process whereby the maker is waiting to receive ideas 
through the manipulation of materials, rather than imposing them onto the materials 
from the outset [4]. 
The process of taking materials from nature to make material objects is known as 
hylomorphism from the Greek hyle (matter) and morphe (form). Ingold considers the 
makers process to be “more humble than those implied by the hylomorphic model” 
and thinks of making as a different process; one of growth where the maker is an active 
participant who ‘joins forces’ with materials “bringing them together or splitting 
them apart, synthesizing and distilling, in anticipation of what might emerge” (ibid). 
Ingold said that. 
In the act of making the artisan couples his own movements and gestures – indeed his very 
life – with the becoming of his materials, joining with and following the forces and ﬂows 
that brings his work into fruition (ibid, p. 31) 
The case study paintings below describe the evolution of a long unstructured 
process. 
Philosopher Gilbert Simondon also questioned hylomorphism. His concept of 
‘individuation’ postulates that form is emergent rather than given in the making 
process; with man inside the world rather than standing on the outside. Theorist and 
psychoanalysts Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari believed also that hylomorphism 
fails to acknowledge, “matter in movement, in ﬂux, in variation” [8]. 
2.5 
Case Study Susan Liggett Paintings 
Painting as a practice remains relevant in the digital age because of what can be learnt 
from it as a creative process. Technology can distance us from the innate human need 
to experiment with materials, whereas painting delights our sense of touch, smell and 
our sight in a visceral, messy and instinctively human way. It can bring us closer to 
the experience of being human. Paradoxically, by not relying on technology it can 
teach us about aspects of experience that technology distances us from.
12
S. Liggett
Liggett describes the process of painting as a ‘psychological resonance’; the 
metaphoric vibration resulting from an inner dialog between ‘subject’ and object’ 
[9]. By this she means that the process connects us with the world in a unique way 
that is dependent on seeing, playing around with materials, and being fully present 
in the world. 
Liggett, like many contemporary painters, exploits technology without being 
reliant on it. She turned to incorporating digital photographs into her work after 
decades of strictly working from direct observation, to question whether if she height-
ened the illusory quality of the paintings, would they in some way get closer to the 
lived experience? (Fig. 2.1). The busyness of her life at the time meant that she felt 
like she had missed the experience of her child growing up so she questioned whether 
the slow reﬂective process of painting would allow her memory to unfold in a richer 
more rewarding way? A photograph taken in a fraction of a second is viewed in the 
same fraction of time, but with a painting the viewer has to look longer to absorb 
signiﬁcance and meaning. 
To her surprise, incorporating the photographic element into the paintings had 
the opposite effect and distanced her memories, with the photographic images not 
standing in for her memories as she thought they would. They evoked something

quite different; the images were familiar but the emotional attachments within the 
paintings were quite separate. She then abandoned the photograph and allowed the 
painterly qualities to bring her closer to the inner experiences of events memorized 
internally (Fig. 2.2). The painterly marks are evidence of her struggles to visualize a 
memory made more vivid through the physical process of grappling with paint. To 
quote Henry James in his novel the ‘Real Thing’: “the unreal is more precious than 
the real” [10]. 
Paintings can only be truly seen from the ﬁrst-person perspective and we bring 
both our eyes and our emotions to the way we respond to them. After viewing 
Vermeer’s paintings, ‘The Love Letter’ (1669/70) and ‘The Music Lesson’, (1662/5) 
Liggett was inspired to make a series of paintings based around the theme of her 
Mother and her dementia (Figs. 2.3 and 2.4). In the works she wanted to imbue a 
metaphoric presence of her Mother as she made sense of her struggles with dementia 
which is represented throught the ghost like arcs that appear incomplete in the image 
(Figs. 2.3 and 2.4).
Another series of paintings the Oneiric Hut Series are inspired by Gaston 
Bachelard’s concept of the “oneiric house” which is a “house of dream-memory” 
[11] that exists within each one of us. Liggett spends a lot of time repeatedly drawing 
the same places or objects in an attempt to evoke and to draw out their poetic qual-
ities in order to do as Cezanne said to “Dream before nature” [12]. Trees and the 
hut are repeatedly drawn from direct observation to test compositions and ideas that 
culminated in a set of paintings that use this repeated hut motif (Figs. 2.5 and 2.6).

The objects that Liggett draws in her garden take on new meanings as the creative 
process transforms the hut that is seen before her eyes into something quite different 
which evocates otherness.
2.6 
Creativity and Research 
An increased understanding of the unique forms of knowledge that art embodies has 
led to an increase in artists undertaking research and studying for research degrees. 
A Ph.D. is now a standard requirement for those teaching in art departments in UK 
universities [13]. Making art always starts from the ﬁrst person perspective of the 
artist which enables conversations to be enriched and imaginations to be evoked. 
Most projects as in Ingold’s account rely on creativity to help to work things out 
as one goes along, to determine the completion of the work or the ends conceived in

advance. There is “interaction and correspondence between articulate and personal 
knowledge”[4] and it is this knowledge, our lived experience that shapes our objective 
reality. 
2.7 
Conclusions 
There is a degree of inherent importance in the making process that can get over-
looked when processes are replaced by technology. However, the process of making 
enables us to connect to the world without rejecting technology. This may be seen in 
the ways painters have adopted and incorporated new technologies into their work. 
The proliferation of the digital has re-positioned painting in relation to the screen 
rather than in its visual representations and has facilitated a recording of ﬁrst-hand 
experiences of the world. Social media, Facebook, Instagram, etc. can give us a

snapshot of our world, but they can sometimes give us a skewed or distorted view, 
whereas the painted image tells us something more akin to the human condition. 
Although it was the photography that taught us the modern idea of the image, it is painting 
that allows us to internalise it [14]. 
Creativity has become a commodity in the market-place with “’the creative indus-
tries’,‘thecreativeeconomy’andthe‘creativeclass’paradigmsofeconomicgrowth” 
[15]. ‘Means and ends’ in contemporary society are often associated with tech-
nological advancements. Many artists do not rely on centralized resources, digital 
transformations or ﬁnancial investments and largely exist outside of ‘markets’ and 
‘political spheres’, and often make a living by other means. This can facilitate more 
independence and greater creativity. 
Interest in technology and art is an expanding ﬁeld and the next chapter explores 
in more depth how technology is utilized by artists.

Creativity and Artist Technologist 
Susan Liggett 
Abstract The study of creativity in the arts provides an opportunity to present the 
ways in which new technology has placed new demands on artists. It can also open 
up new possibilities for the expression of creativity by artists. It expands on the ways 
in which technology is used by artists as a tool to reﬂect on the human aspiration 
for a better future. The artists’ collective localStyle is presented as a case study to 
demonstrate how collaborations between artists, scientists and technologists has led 
to multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary projects.

Introduction 
The development of new technologies in the 1960s prompted a new generation of 
artists to experiment with the new media, thus transforming understandings of art. 
New media art is the term given to all forms of contemporary art made, altered, 
or transmitted using technologies developed since the 1980s. It is ever-expanding 
and deﬁes categorization. It includes artists using a range of ‘off the shelf’ software 
or learning coding to make artworks that are contained only in digital ﬁles. Unlike 
painting, which has an historic established lineage, new media art has attracted artists 
from different disciplines and with divergent viewpoints. For example, some artists 
in the ﬁeld of music, dance and sculpture have used video as medium to forge new 
strategies for art making [1]. 
3.2 
Origins of Art and Technology 
A characteristic of twentieth century art has been its questioning of painting as 
a privileged medium for making art. As early as the late nineteenth century the 
artist Eadweard Muybridge (1830–1904) was a pioneer in manipulating photographic

images. His motion picture projections were arguably the ﬁrst time that art and 
technology coexisted. 
In 1966 the artists Robert Rauschenberg (1925–2008) and Robert Whitman 
(b.1935) founded the non-proﬁt making organization E.A.T. (Experiments in Art 
and Technology) with engineers from Bell Telephone Laboratories (the research 
component of the AT&T telephone conglomerate). Traditional art forms such as 
painting were seen by some as obsolete, and Rauschenberg declared: 
If you don’t accept technology you better go to another place, because no place is safe 
here……Nobody wants to paint rotten oranges anymore [2]. 
The subjectivity of art has challenged research communities that are entrenched in 
the scientiﬁc method. However, increasingly science communities are working with 
artists in recognition that their methodological approaches involve problem ﬁnding, 
as opposed to problem solving, and this can lead to productive collaborations. 
The European laboratory for Particle Physics CERN recognizes the importance of 
fostering dialogs between artists and scientists and offers artists residencies, commis-
sions and an events program to build bridges between the two cultures [3]. Dutch artist 
Rosa Menkman was resident at CERN Collide between 2019–2021, and artworks 
(Fig. 3.1) resulting from her continuous dialog with physicists and engineers were 
exhibited at SJSU art galleries in the USA in March 2020 [4].

Digital Artworks 
Digital photography has assisted the process of digital transformation of society. For 
example, 95 million photos and videos were shared on Instagram per day in 2021 
[5]. Russell Kirsch (1929–2020), the scientist who invented the digital image scanner 
that created the ﬁrst digital photograph (Fig. 3.2), has enabled images to be produced, 
reproduced, repositioned, reﬁned and combined in unique new ways. 
Early experiments in computer art involved computer scientists and mathemati-
cians. In the1960s it was only research laboratories and large corporations that could 
afford computers. It wasn’t until the ‘plotter’; a device to hold a pen was developed, 
that artist such as Frieder Nake became a pioneer in using the computer creatively 
to produce computer art. Curator Barbara London, on seeing her ﬁrst computer art 
show in 1970, thought. 
the programming was outstanding but the art was uninspiring” [7]. She noted that, the 
engineers were blessed with expansive technical skills but tended to have limited visual 
imagination [7]. 
This is no longer the case as cultural computing is now a ﬁeld in itself with 
organizations such as The Computer Arts Society that is a specialist interest group 
of the British Computer Society, (The Chartered Institute for IT) [8]. Since 1990 
Electronic Visualisation and the Arts (EVA) has organized annual conferences 
to bring together the application of new technologies to the arts and cultural 
domains [9].

Art and Science Collaborative Research 
The effectiveness of the contemporary arts in assessing non-art concerns has given it 
credibility in its role in multi-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary research. This has 
resulted in artists’ interventions becoming more inﬂuential in citizen science. 
The collaborative artistic platform, localStyle, creates artworks that are displayed 
in galleries and open public spaces, which helps to highlight problems associated 
with the climate emergency and resource extraction. The collaborative artistic plat-
form localStyle creates artworks that are displayed in galleries and open public 
spaces, which helps to highlight problems associated with the climate emergency and 
resource extraction. The founders, the visual artist Marlena Novak and the composer, 
Jay Alan Yim, critically re-assess these ‘Grand Challenges’ and have engaged the 
expertise of a number of scientists for their projects. They often present works and 
events together with the collective known as ‘Deep Time Chicago’, which is part 
of a global movement working around the theme of the Anthropocene and includes 
artists, cultural theorists and a biologist [10].

Case Study—LocalStyle: Choral and Timeslips 
The climate change themed projection “Choral”, is a project created in collaboration 
with researchers to raise awareness of the necessity to protect coral habitats. These 
play an important role in ocean conservation. The habitats that the coral create are 
fundamental to the sustainability of a quarter of all marine species and the livelihoods 
of 500 million people around the planet. Novak has said 
these eco systems are in crisis and we hope that the public will be engaged by the beauty and 
charisma of these creatures and then it will lead to greater appreciation for ocean conservation 
efforts [11] 
Choral is a 12 min audio visual installation commissioned by 150 Media Stream 
for a sculpturally unique LED panel display (Fig. 3.3).
The resulting artwork from this project is now part of the world’s largest permanent 
digital art projection onto a public building Art on theMART. Initial iterations of the 
work were on display at 150 N Riverside Plaza Chicago (Fig. 3.4) [12].
Another localStyle art/science project is “Timeslips” (Fig. 3.5); a video installation 
commissioned by the Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin (HKW) [13] and the Max-
Planck-Institut für Wissenschaftsgeschichte in 2019. Exhibited in venues in the USA, 
Berlin, and London, the artwork places the viewer in the mind of an agronomist 
working on Mars, who ponders the injustices created by humans attempt to control 
water on Earth. The title refers to a pause in time caused by Mars having a rotational 
period slightly longer than that of Earth; with the solution to that difference being a 
programmed pause between 00:00:00 midnight and 00:01:00. This “Timeslip”, when 
the clock is suspended, is described by the narrator as a time when the past and present

collide, and a time used for introspection, reﬂection, and mindfulness. Inspired by 
Kim Stanley Robinson’s Mars Trilogy novels (1992), the narrator remembers the 
absurdity of water management on planet earth, 34 million miles away, where either 
too much or too little water is problematic.

HKW commissioned localStyle to develop an iteration of Timeslips which 
resulted in a sculptural assisted readymade “Fourteen Slices of Time” (2020) 
(Fig. 3.6). Fourteen custom-printed postcards with ﬁlm stills from “Timeslips” were 
displayed on a simple stand that ﬁts inside an American mailbox to act as souvenirs 
that trigger memories of Earth.
The Mississippi as an Anthropocene river and is the theme several of localStyle’s 
work. “Re-percussions” (2021) (Fig. 3.7) was an artwork made to support the resis-
tance against the Line 3 oil pipeline in Chicago. This pipeline in Minnesota which 
has been routed through agricultural and sacred land in violation of an existing treaty 
with the indigenous Anishinaabe native Americans.
3.6 
Discussion 
Often science and technology may be perceived as the primary driver in a material 
world, resulting in the arts and humanities being forced into a more reactive position. 
However, when questions are asked about the values of the science, or the meaning 
that technological developments have uncovered, these disciplines are often at a loss. 
It may be regarded as ‘beyond science’. At the same time, art practice has been forced 
by these developments to think of knowledge acquisition outside that of art alone. 
Therefore, all parties can be beneﬁciaries of collaboration as has been seen from the 
case studies in this chapter.

Art is a catalyst for knowledge acquisition with art theory and practice leading to 
questions outside that of art alone. Curatorial and institutional notions of ‘research’, 
as seen in museums and art galleries, complements research in the humanities, the 
natural sciences, and the social sciences. Curator Tom Holert predicts a sea change in 
the understanding of the power and reach of artistic research [14]. A new paradigm 
for artistic research was also debated in ‘The Postresearch Condition’ EARN/Smart 
Culture Conference in Utrecht in the spring of 2021. Art is often embedded within 
transdisciplinary research environments. Artist Amanda Beech describes how when 
we think of research we are drawn to “ends”, but for the arts and humanities knowing 
requires a conceptualization of something that is beyond the usual measures imposed 
on knowledge production [15]. 
3.7 
Conclusions 
The impact of research all too often is drawn to the use of scientiﬁc reasoning and 
metrics to quantify the social or economic impact of research, but sometimes it takes 
artists to make sure this knowledge is really understood. localStyle’s work is deeply 
embedded in the dynamics of social and political life. Their critique and reﬂection 
on climate action offers more than an esthetic solution; but an ethical, political, and 
psychological sense of responsibility that raises awareness and makes a relevant 
contribution to society.

Scientiﬁc and artistic thinking give us two complementary tools to understand the 
complexity of the world with science reducing experience to essential principles and 
art intensifying and expanding our experiences. The novelist A. S. Byatt said 
art explores connections like those in ways very different from science’s ordering – even 
though scientists are aided by ﬂashes of inspiration [16]. 
Together art and science give us harmonizing views and explore in different ways 
the complexity of knowing and understanding the world. 
Chapter 4 explores how artistic research exploits the technological age to create 
new artworks often created in collaboration that reﬂect upon knowledge production 
and notions of reality.

Creativity and Virtual Worlds 
Susan Liggett 
Abstract The relationship between the real world and the internet is explored. The 
real and the virtual are separate but intersecting and overlapping worlds as far as 
audiences are concerned. What is the effect of a work created on the internet on 
the real world, and vice-versa? The rise of the internet and its effect on creativity 
is examined. Technology has changed the production and distribution of artworks 
to audiences. Repositories such as art galleries and museums can exist as virtual 
entities and enable audiences to view, and interact with, artifacts and artworks. Such 
repositories can change the ways in which audiences view and perceive artworks.

Introduction 
In recent years, there has been a surge in artists experimenting with new technologies 
to express ideas, expand audiences, or to problematize and critique the implications 
that technology has on the future. Through making artworks in the internet age, they 
have tested the limits of technology to explore notions of truth and accounts of reality. 
The ways the internet has inﬂuenced creativity is explored and questions how 
human experiences have been impacted by new technologies. It examines the ideas 
of theorist and philosopher Boris Groys (b.1947). It asks what does it mean for an 
original work of art to have what Walter Benjamin called an ‘aura’; when today the 
original artwork may only exist as a computer ﬁle? 
Examples of artworks that use virtual and augmented reality to create immersive 
environments are explored. A more in-depth case study of the work of British Roma-
nian Artist Ioana Pioaru is presented. Pioaru has developed virtual holography; a 
new method for art making.

4.2 
Technology and Places of Creativity 
Today the internet is the place where artists produce and distribute artworks. The 
gap has closed between the space of production and the space of exhibiting art, with 
many artists using their computing device and no longer needing dedicated studios 
and specialist equipment. The distribution of artwork on the internet has led to the 
globalization of the artist/author, with social media helping to grow reputations from 
the local to the global. The internet allows the viewer to see work in progress and to 
express judgements on quality thus changing the way in which art is critiqued. 
According to the art critic and philosopher Boris Groys (b.1947) in the internet 
age the institutional power of the Museum has collapsed. In his book “In the Flow” 
(2016) [1] he gives an account of how museums and galleries no longer determine the 
quality and status of an artwork. Central to the argument is a reminder that although 
the internet is a virtual space, it has a ﬁxed reference point—‘ofﬂine reality’; and 
it refers back to this reality in every interaction ‘including economic transactions, 
surveillance and military operations’ (ibid). 
British artist Daniel Buzzo uses the internet as a venue for inspiration, production 
and the distribution of his artwork. Human computer interaction with the internet 
is a central theme to his work, as demonstrated in his piece Signs of Surveillance: 
Dataset for training machine vision systems” (Fig. 4.1) [2]. His work emphasizes 
the internet as a machine of surveillance as exempliﬁed by 
It divides the ﬂow of data into small, traceable and reversible operations, and thus exposes 
ever user to its surveillance [1].

A digital image can never be really copied (as it depends on its original context). 
It is always newly staged or performed and every act of seeing an image or reading 
a text on the internet is traceable. Buzzo’s work acknowledges the impact of this 
on the status quo, and suggests that secrecy is difﬁcult when one is under constant 
surveillance, and when the only way we can preclude others is by the use of protected 
passwords. Groys argues that today subjectivity has become a ‘technical construc-
tion’, and that we have become keepers of secrets; that is by knowing our passwords 
(ibid). 
4.3 
Creativity and Being Human 
Creativity is a human trait and the making of art is one way in which the individual, 
who is at the center of a continually changing realm of experience, makes sense of the 
world. According to Carl Roger, the founder of person-centered therapy, reality for 
the individual is constructed from the way in which this experience is internalized 
to construct an internal frame of reference. Making art helps understand human 
experience through empathy. This is 
The state of empathy, or being empathic, is to perceive the internal frame of reference of 
another with accuracy and with the emotional components and meanings which pertain 
thereto as if one were the person [3] 
For this reason, the computer cannot create genuine artworks as there is no internal 
frame of reference for it to originate from unless one is created. Unlike the human 
creative imagination, where ﬁctions can be created and played out through art, the 
internet cannot create art because it has no capacity to draw on human experience 
creating dream worlds that inspire art. Internet information is always information 
about something in, or derived from, the real world; there are no ﬁctional referents 
[1]. 
Ali Nikrang, a research artist at Ars Electronica Futurelab, is fascinated by the 
limitations of AI-based music, and the artiﬁcial creation of meaning. He says that 
AI may be able to generate pleasing music, but it has no creative value or higher 
meaning [4]. 
According to Groys, we perceive artworks as real and tangible things, but 
one can say that on the Internet there is no art and literature, but only information about art 
and literature [1]. 
The reality found on the internet is a different kind of reality; one that creates 
different sorts of experiences. Philosopher Walter Benjamin (1892–1940) in his essay 
“The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1935) said that artworks 
change once we can reproduce them, the glow of authenticity that he calls their ‘aura’ 
falls away when you are not experiencing the original; suggesting the viewer has a 
diminished art experience [5].

With human behavior adapting and altering rapidly due to the pandemic Covid-19, 
the pace of change has been accelerated in the adoption of the virtual. The EVA2021 
conference held a symposium panel to ask 
how has art, identity and human digital behaviour’ been transformed and what will it mean 
to be human in a post-Covid, post-digital world? [6]. 
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab researcher, Kate 
Darling, argues in her book “The New Breed” (2021) that we would be better prepared 
for the future if we started thinking about robots and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) as 
animals; suggesting that comparing them to humans is limited (Fig. 4.2). We need to 
think creatively about their potential as collaborators and companions [7]. Scientists 
in Japan are working on robots to locate and detonate mines that look like spiders, 
caterpillars and crabs [8].

Virtual Reality Holography a Case Study—Ioana 
Pioaru 
Pioaru developed the original technique of virtual reality (VR) holography between 
2016–21 for her Ph.D. study [9]. This new art form synthesizes the qualities of 
traditional hand-drawing with the features of holography and virtual reality. It enabled

the showcasing of VR artworks outside of VR space, without the need of a headset. 
To date one of the limitations in VR media is that perceiving the three-dimensionality 
of VR artworks depends on wearing a headset through which to access the virtual 
space where the work resides. Pioaru was frustrated by this as it restricts the number 
of people who can view the artwork at one time, although access to a Cave could 
have addressed this to some degree. Her work was therefore only accessible to the 
wider public in a ﬂattened version via an online 2D galleries. To overcome this, she 
developed VR holographic art; the ﬁrst in the world at this time that could be displayed 
outside VR, while at the same time preserving its volumetric presence. Pioaru deﬁnes 
VR art as the type of artistic content created directly inside the VR environment 
using an application designed speciﬁcally for the purpose of art making. This may 
be contrasted with computer-generated content presented in VR: making it distinctive 
and different from anything ever seen before. Holograms do not photograph well— 
they have to be experienced to fully grasp the intimacy of every hand drawn line 
sculpted and illuminated in space [10]. 
The internet space references data from the real world, rather than ﬁctional worlds. 
Ioana Pioaru’s virtual holography artworks present the experience of ﬁctional worlds 
brought into the real world through drawing. This is an attempt to capture something 
beyond a perfect replica of an object or thing, but seeks to portray an impression that 
touches our emotions. 
Pioaru’s work goes beyond the usual hyper real of holography, through an explo-
ration of the boundaries between sculpture and drawing as in the sculptural and print 
work as seen in Meditation on a Machinic Cube (Fig. 4.3).
In her holographic works ‘Spectral Figures’ (2019) (Fig. 4.4) the viewer experi-
ences every hand drawn line that becomes more tangible as you move closer to it as 
a physical object. To fully comprehend the work a close scrutiny is needed (ibid). 
‘Warhol’ (2019) (Fig. 4.4) is a holograph smaller than human scale, yet every visible 
sharp illuminated line leaves an impression of what it must have felt like to be the 
artist making the work. As your eyes trace the lines, a tactile and visceral experience 
is evoked when viewing the work.
Comparing the drawing ‘The Bronte Sisters’ (2022) (Fig. 4.5) to hologram 
‘Spectral Figures’ (2019–2020) (Fig. 4.4), the hologram transports the viewer into 
the process of the drawing itself; helping an understanding of the very human 
decision-making process that are often hidden in digital media artworks.
Pioaru ﬁrst started using the 3D-painting virtual-reality Google Application Tilt 
Brush in 2017 to produce sculptural drawings (Figs. 4.6 and 4.7). She describes how 
it offers the user a fully immersive experience that is entertaining. However, for her, it 
was the 3D design platform Gravity Sketch that proved to be the game changer with 
the level of editability and precision far superior to Tilt Brush [11]. It was through 
this that Pioaru adapted her VR art making method to the speciﬁcity of holography 
instead of drawing on a white background with black strokes, I realised that a much better 
result would be achieved by drawing with white lines in a dark environment. This method 
routes the light energy available from the hologram into the drawing lines more effectively; 
and since the drawing lines usually occupy a much smaller solid angle in total than the 
background, the relative brightness of the lines can be much higher (ibid).

Ioana Pioaru makes preparatory drawings (Fig. 4.8) to acquaint herself with the 
volumetric structure of her subject before converting them to light rather than dark 
outlines within Gravity Sketch. In traditional drawing a 3D object is rendered in 2D, 
but in virtual space the 2D sketches create the sculptural drawing (Fig. 4.9).
Two recent exhibitions of her work include Gallery 286, London (2022) (Fig. 4.10) 
[12] and “Holographic Embodiment”, Centre for the Holographic Arts, New York 
(2019) [13].
The post-processing step is done with the help of the holography company Geola 
who are developing a tool to help artists with this process of preparing ﬁles for 
printing [14]. 
Brieﬂy, this consists of reapplying the correct colours to the volumes, setting up the 
‘holoplane’ (a virtual plane that simulates the holographic plate) and positioning an 
animated camera at the correct distance from the holoplane using a method described by 
Brotherton-Ratcliffe and Bjelkhagen [15].

can be viewed without the need of a headset, conventionally needed to view all other 
VR creations (Fig. 4.11).

Conclusions 
Artists are attracted to Virtual and Augmented Reality to create immersive experi-
ences. Through experiments with publically available platforms such as Tilt Brush 
and Gravity Sketch, they have pushed the boundaries of technology to present alter-
natives for the use of these new technologies. Artist Ioana Pioaru exploits these tools 
to develop Virtual Reality Holography, a new method for art making. 
Artists increasingly exploit and evaluate developing technologies in a range of 
ways that can lead to new commercial possibilities or in ways that critique its social 
consequences. They have been inspired by augmented reality, virtual, reality, arti-
ﬁcial intelligence and machine learning. An appraisal of these new platforms is 
both practically and conceptually ongoing more for than two decades since Boris 
Groys proclaimed in his book a radical shift in our image culture ‘from aesthetics 
to autopoetics’. That is, ‘to the production of one’s own public self’. As a result of 
these advances in new technology, artists are working more collaboratively, and in a 
more democratic way that is decentralized and de-authorized’ to reﬂect and embody 
our networked selves [19]. 
Chapter 5 examines how collaborations are generating new ways of working 
creatively in community spaces to generate new ideas and perspectives on collective 
rather than individual endeavors.

The Creative Process and Social 
Responsibility 
Susan Liggett 
Abstract Creativity can have a communal aspect when a group of people have a 
common goal. With the added advantage of an objective, creativity can be channeled 
and directed in speciﬁc directions and become centered around a focused set of ideas 
and principles. This can be applied to particular areas of human concern such as civic 
society, health and well-being, health services, rehabilitation, business regeneration, 
wartime resilience, and preparing for the future. Examples from these areas are 
presented in order to understand how creativity has been instrumental in achieving 
positive goals and has acted as a driver and motivator of change for individuals and 
communities.

Introduction 
The British academic and writer, Oli Mould, suggests alternative ways of thinking 
about creativity. He sees it not as a neoliberal commodity, but more a freedom to 
reimagine the future. For Mould, creativity is not an individual trait, that selﬁshly 
exploits the marketplace, but a collective endeavor that can improve society without a 
focus on proﬁt [1]. This modus operandi is evident in many current artist-led creative 
projects that sit outside the traditional market model, and rather than promoting the 
individual, they promote artists’ collective actions. Socially engaged art practices are 
collaborative, often participatory, and involve people as the medium for debate or 
social interaction. This chapter describes the ways in which artists have contributed 
to the Covid-19 pandemic recovery through community action, useful art, arts in 
health and digital health. Ty Pawb, a creative collective hub and gallery in Wrexham 
North Wales is presented as a case study to demonstrates the unique way in which an 
arts organization can serve communities and foster creative resilience for the public 
good.

Creativity Technology and Social Responsibility 
Over recent years, there has been a growing understanding and awareness of the 
impact that participating in the arts can have on health and well-being. The arts are 
uniquely placed to help people to gain a greater sense of control over their lives. 
Having a sense of personal control has been identiﬁed as a key to wellbeing [2]. 
Complementing medicine and care, the arts can improve the health of people, prevent 
disease, and promote well-being. 
Technology has enabled the spread of creative projects and social movements that 
are key to health and wellbeing through facilitating the documenting and sharing of 
projects on the internet to new audiences. For example, the British artists and curators 
Frances Williams, Anthony Schrag and Becky Shaw critique the instrumentalization 
of the arts in the ﬁeld of ‘arts in health’ by staged interventions that are documented 
for dissemination beyond the live event itself. They curated a number of arts projects 
with student nurses at Kings College London, entitled “Hiding in Plain Sight” to 
comment on the UK National Health Service cuts and austerity measures, by offering 
the arts through social prescribing to ameliorate health service pressures [3]. 
Their short ﬁlm, “The Song of the Compassionate Robot” [4] comes from their 
‘Secret Society of Imperfect Nurses’ and takes a near-future vision of nursing. In 
it the robot nurse suggests that the health care system is broken (ibid) and cannot 
accommodate human ‘creativity’, because of a lack of time. 
‘Creative Health’ is the term used to describe a movement of artists and health 
professionals campaigning for healthcare systems to better utilize the creative arts in 
supporting health and wellbeing outcomes. The World Health Organization (WHO) 
recognizes that digital technologies can accelerate health innovation. Digital health 
has rapidly accelerated since the Covid-19 pandemic and The World Health Summit 
[5], ViVE [6], Reuters Digital Health [7] and The World Medical Innovation Forum 
[8] are now staging digital health conferences. One example of digital health inno-
vation is graphic designer/academic Raﬁq Elmansy’s adherence canvas research 
project. This focuses on the role of design thinking and technology in improving 
patient adherence to self-administered treatment technology (Figs. 5.1 and 5.2) [9]. 
If creativity leads to invention and invention leads to new innovations, then artists 
will always be necessary. FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology) is

an arts organization in Liverpool that supports digital culture and enriches lives 
with exhibitions, ﬁlm screenings and arts projects. Their workshop program DO 
SOMETHING SATURDAYS is aimed at whole families to engage in technology 
creatively, such as to bring digital avatars to life and provide an opportunity to play 
around with augmented reality. Game artist Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley invited the 
public to join his “Imaginists Society”, inviting the public to be part of a real-life 
video game and is also creating artworks with a group of local young people [10]. 
American artist and scientist Donna Cox champions the skills in visualization that 
an artist brings to ‘Renaissance Teams’ when working synergistically with others in 
the quest for knowledge [11]. Cox, a pioneer of computer art and scientiﬁc visu-
alization, initially worked with research scientists at NCSA (National Center for 
Supercomputing Applications) because they needed visually literate people to visu-
alize data changes [12]. In some projects she acts as programmer, in others a color 
expert, a designer, a maker, an animator, or even a producer. 
5.3 
Useful Art 
The internet has enabled the collective growth of social movements such as The Arte 
Útil (useful art) inspired by Cuban artist Tania Bruguera. This movement advocates
44
S. Liggett
artistic thinking for positive changes in response to current urgencies. According to 
Brugueras “Arte Útil” should be part of everyday life: it should be a daily exercise 
in creativity”. She sees art as a proposal to society to develop something that can be 
implemented with ‘hope’ and ‘belief and maintains that ‘art is living the future in 
the present’ [13]. 
The Arte Útil movement is promoted on arts organizations websites such as The 
Whitworth Gallery [14], and The City Lab, which is part of the Institute of Art and 
Technology at Liverpool John Moores University School of Art and Design [15]. 
The Association of Arte Útil has developed a shared open-source research platform 
known as Decentralising Political Economies [16]. This ongoing project led by the 
academic John Byrne offers online toolkits, including recoding of seminars, research 
resources, interviews, artist’s activities and action research [17, 18]. This research 
uses artistic thinking to test other ways of living together in recognition of the limits of 
current systems and the impact of Covid 19 on society. Mindful of Black Lives Matter 
and Climate Catastrophe the project will contribute to an exhibition “Economics: The 
Blockbuster” scheduled for 2023 at the Whitworth, Manchester [19].

Case Study—Innovative Creative Environments: Lle 
Celf Defnyddiol, Tˆy Pawb, Wrexham, Wales 
A ﬁnalist for the Art Fund Museum of the Year 2022, Tˆy Pawb, is a cultural commu-
nity resource in Wrexham that hosts a public gallery and market under one roof that 
promotes useful art [20]. 
Play is recognized as an important component of creativity at Tˆy Pawb, and is 
nurtured through every element of the site. Even the ﬁttings are designed and made by 
furniture maker Tim Denton [21] in dialog with Lucicology—the playwork experts 
y who have a track record of encouraging local authority departments and partner 
agencies to develop more play-centered policies [22]. 
Tim Denton’s Hippodrome Lampshade was inspired by the Art Deco light that 
hung in the Hippodrome Cinema in Wrexham until its closure in 1997. The light 
was restored to its former glory and given a new home in Ty Pawb when it opened in 
2018. The bent plywood lampshade was designed for a social engagement project in 
collaboration with Ty Pawb and the charity CAIS, which is part of Adferiad Recovery 
helping people with the recovery from drugs, alcohol and mental health problems. 
The lampshade is being made and produced by volunteer from the charity to develop 
their skills and encourage personal growth through the design process (Fig. 5.3).
The market trader Steve Tapp has a trainer revival business based in Ty Pawb and 
sells refurbished trainers all over the world, using the internet (Fig. 5.4). The artistic 
community and a creative environment are perfect for his business, which in turn 
brings new audiences to the art gallery. It is an excellent example of the symbiotic 
relationship between business and art that a useful art space can bring.

Ty Pawb has a strong creative community and has commissioned a short docu-
mentary ﬁlm, which premiered at Black History Month, Wrexham October 2019. 
It featured artist Anya Paintsil (Fig. 5.5), locktician/hair stylist Rutcher Gomes and 
braid stylist Admilda Rocha Da Gloria (Teca) who were celebrated for working 
innovatively with hair [23]. 
In the ﬁlm, the three artists discuss how their creative practices developed 
differently in Wrexham and frequently using similar skills and tools. 
During the height of the pandemic Tˆy Pawb launched “Lle Celf Ddefnyddiol”, 
translated as “The Useful Art Space”; a space that offers communities a virtual and 
physical place to focus on creativity. Its aim is to use art as a tool for the people 
of North-East Wales to ‘reimagine’ a collective future and to practice the ethos of 
useful art for social change. “Lle Celf Ddefnyddiol” features as a case study for the 
Arte Útil movement website [24]. 
The Lle Celf Ddefnyddiol/the Useful Art Space gets transformed with its ﬂexible 
furniture to accommodate Bom Dia Cymru (Good Morning Wales); a creative group 
led by artist Noemi Santos, who works in collaboration with Wrexham’s Portuguese 
language speaking community that creates artifacts to be sold in the market. There 
is also a group for refugees and asylum seekers working with the artist Ibukun 
Baldwin, who teaches them textiles, ceramics, printing, embroidery, accessory and 
product design skills to make things to also sell in the market hall. A separate Maker 
Space in the gallery supports the development of creative practices that may lead to 
start-up businesses. The artist and designer, Lorna Bates, was given a residency to 
showcase her surface pattern designs and launch her business (Fig. 5.6). Tara Dean

worked with the cARTrefu Age Cymru project that places artists in care homes to 
create a collection of greetings cards. Georgia Nielson, a ﬁnal year ﬁne art student at 
Glyndwr University, after graduating, took residency at Ty Pawb as an opportunity 
to set herself up in a career making rugs and banners (Fig. 5.7). 
There are also touring exhibitions at Ty Pawb. For example, the work of ‘Tatty 
Devine’ was on show in 2021, in an exhibition supported by the Crafts Council 
[25]. ‘Tatty Devine’ is a company founded by the jewelry designers Harriet Vine and 
Rosie Wolfenden (Fig. 5.8). They promote their craft work (Fig. 5.9) by making kits, 
entering competitions, setting up workshops and publish blogs on their website [26].
Creativity and collective action are aided by technology. Ty Pawb’s website and 
social media sites have assisted in expanding audiences and have utilized community 
assets to encourage new collaborations.

Possibilities for the Future 
Art and politics are united in a desire to shape the future and recognize that creativity 
is an important tool for social change. The ﬁeld of arts in health, that began as a 
social movement introducing the arts into hospital and community health settings, 
is now as global phenomenon. Participatory art projects and other models such as 
‘social prescribing’ in which the arts are integrated into healthcare use technology as 
a facilitative tool. Digital health is another new ﬁeld that integrates technology and 
health and includes mobile health (mHealth), health information technology (IT), 
wearable devices, telehealth and telemedicine, and personalized medicine. The Arte 
Útil movement reminds us of the importance of living ‘the future in the present’ 
through using art as a social tool to deal with issues that cannot be solved purely 
politically. 
The future is one in which technology plays an increasing role in advancing 
society. However, Boris Groys warns that the future could be radically changed by 
technology with both positive and negative consequences such as dehumanization 
or even cyber wars [27]. The current war in Ukraine is a time to reﬂect on such a
50
S. Liggett
catastrophic possibility of cyberwars, but art always offers hope. For example, the 
photograph of the little girl Valeriia ﬂeeing Ukraine and entering Poland has become 
a symbol of hope. The Ukrainian photographer, Artem Lurchenko, shot the image 
using a drone and then the French photographer and grafﬁti artist, JR, used the image 
to stage a public art event [28] to publicize Ukraine’s wartime resilience to the world. 
He printed out a 148 foot version of the photo onto a tarpaulin and traveled to Lviv 
enlisting more than 100 Ukrainian volunteers to reveal the artwork in an event shared 
on Instagram [29]. The artist’ aim was to use art to change the war, launching a NFT 
(non-fungible token) to raise money for those impacted by the conﬂict. 
5.6 
Conclusion 
What unites artists and politicians is a desire to shape the future, but political ideas 
quickly become obsolete and give way to the politics of the future. It was the 
French philosopher Michel Foucault’s Heterotopian promise that ‘artists transport 
the present into the future’, thus doing their work not for their own time but for the 
future [30]. Politics shapes the future by its disappearance yet art shapes the future by 
its prolonged presence [31]. Social movements such as Arte Útil and those promoting 
arts in health are examples of ways in which creativity enables societies to reﬂect on 
the future while living in the present. 
Chapter 6 takes a different approach to social responsibility and collaboration 
through an exploration of creativity in science in technology. Here research environ-
ments include interdisciplinary teams and technology enhanced collaborations that 
allow for more creative and effective projects.

Digital Communication as a Creative 
Tool 
Rae Earnshaw and Susan Liggett 
Abstract The progress of computing and digital media is a relevant and useful case 
study in tools for creativity. Which visions of the future in the early days of computing 
have stood the test of time, and which have vanished without trace? Can this be used 
as guide for current and future areas of research and development? If one Internet year 
is equivalent to seven calendar years, are virtual worlds being utilized as an effective 
accelerator for these new creative ideas and their implementation and evaluation? 
The nature of digital media and its constituent parts which integrate technology and 
various forms of creative media provides a diverse environment which can be viewed 
as a testbed for current and future ideas. Individual disciplines utilize virtual worlds 
in different ways. As collaboration is often involved in such research environments, 
does the technology make these collaborations more creative and effective? Three 
Case Studies (European Projects) are included to illustrate how creativity can be 
enabled and stimulated in three kinds of collaborative virtual environments. Two 
further Case Studies are also included to illustrate how multimedia assets may be 
harnessed and made available to viewers.

Introduction 
Humans have had an inherent need to create and since the dawn of civilization they 
have been visualizing ideas using drawings and models to research designs that 
communicate concepts that transform and even change traditions. Creative expres-
sion can advance ideas and contribute something new, but at the same time this is 
inevitably linked to the social and cultural experiences of individuals and commu-
nities within which these artifacts were created. The quality of the art produced by 
a nation is a by-product of the extent to which its culture, traditions and economy 
is developed. Artworks can deﬁne these cultures, secure their place in history, and 
provide a legacy for future generations. Communication is an important element in 
creativity with openness and integrity required on the part of the communicator and 
the receiver(s). Such openness shows a willingness to engage with new ideas and

new cultural contexts, and also to reciprocate through sharing ideas and facts in a 
quest for new understandings of different concepts. 
Thus, the development of human creativity has been transformed by communi-
cation sources that transfer information such as speech, writing, images, reading, 
observing, and printing. Tools have been developed to assist in this, with the printing 
press being a signiﬁcant example of how the sharing of information has facilitated the 
process of learning. The increased capacity to communicate means that many chan-
nels are now available allowing communities to be more open and innovative. News 
ways of thinking and working are able to support the generation of new concepts and 
ideas more readily than closed environments. 
6.2 
Computer-Assisted Creativity 
New tools, frameworks, and scenarios for the expression of new ideas and new 
designs, are now available, as well as an increase in the use of digital environments 
that delivers new types of interactions within which ideas can be generated, revealed, 
and discovered. The degree to which new technologies advance the creative process 
is discussed along with the central factors that govern it and how it is augmented 
and analyzed. The ever-increasing volume of information being generated and circu-
lated by digital systems is equivalent to that brought about by the printing press 
and could thus constitute a new technological paradigm. The extent to which this 
may constitute a paradigm shift on the status quo is analyzed. Extracting meaning 
and knowledge from very large sets of information is a signiﬁcant challenge often 
requiring multidisciplinary expertise from a range of discipline backgrounds. 
The Internet and the digital world represent a substantial change to the way much 
of global society operated in earlier eras. It is relevant to consider such a change 
in the context of Kuhn’s concept of paradigm shift evidenced in the scientiﬁc and 
industrial revolutions [1]. There are substantial differences between the medieval 
era and the modern era brought about by a greater understanding and application 
of scientiﬁc analysis. However, the extent of this change normally only becomes 
apparent sometime after it has taken place, when there has been opportunity to 
reﬂect on the signiﬁcance of the developments and advancements that have taken 
place consequent upon the change. 
The evidence to date in favor of the Internet and the digital world being a paradigm 
shift is that they were completely new. The complicating factor is that many of the uses 
and applications that developed out of this digital framework operated in a more basic 
form prior to this. Thus, the key question for future historians to answer is whether 
the Internet and the digital world can demonstrate that major new developments and 
transformations followed directly from this digital foundation, and that they did not 
exist before, and would not have followed on naturally from changes in science or 
society. They were major and transformational and, as for the Scientiﬁc Revolution, 
it is unlikely we would wish to a return (at least in a practical sense) to the state before
6

55
the revolution happened. This supports the argument for a paradigm shift associated 
with the digital world. 
What are the key aspects of this paradigm shift in the digital world that can most 
affect society? In this section it is proposed that connectivity and hybridity enable 
and facilitate the digital world’s transformative effects. 
6.3 
Interaction and Collaboration 
An important component of creativity is communication. This presupposes a degree 
of openness on the part of the communicator and the recipients(s). Such openness 
indicates a readiness to receive new ideas and new cultural contexts, and also recipro-
cate by sharing information. Thus, the development of human creativity has depended 
to a large extent on speech, writing, images, reading, observing, and printing. The 
latter took a major step forward with the development of the printing press. This has 
greatly facilitated the process of learning and the sharing of information. 
There are various theories as to what purpose historic cave paintings served but 
one aspect of their production is clear which is that they all involve an interaction of 
a human with some kind of tool. The human has used the tool and pigments to create 
a painting on the wall of a cave to represent in visual form aspects of their live that 
they have intimate knowledge of such as the hunting of animals. 
The relationship of the human to the animal could have been preserved in some 
form of verbal tradition but through the cave drawing something additional to this 
was also practiced and has been preserved. This form of creative expression arose 
out of experiences with the external world. A human’s ability to interact with their 
environment in a conscious and creative way is what distinguishes them from the 
animals that don’t interact through conscious reasoning but through instinct and habit. 
Humans used tools from the earliest eras, formed from various kinds of materials. 
6.4 
Virtual Environments and Creativity 
Tools are utilized in order to interact with a virtual environment where a visual 
representation of an object can be designed or manipulated (Fig. 6.1). Immersive 
walk-in environments (such as a Cave—Fig. 6.2) enables the user to be surrounded 
by a virtual representation as if it were the real world, allowing human potential for 
creativity to be facilitated by technology. Conversely, if the technology is not fully 
oriented to the user’s way of working then it can act as an inhibitor and a constraint. 
This underlines the importance of having well-designed user interfaces that enable 
the users to interact in creative ways with the virtual worlds via the technology.
The name CAVE is thought to be a reference to the allegory of the Cave in Plato’s 
Republic. Virtual environments are akin to the allegory in which philosophers chained 
to the wall of their cave contemplate perception, reality and illusion though watching

the shadows projected on the wall from objects passing in front of a ﬁre lit behind 
them. The user’s immersion in the Cave as depicted in Fig. 6.2 is thought to provide 
an additional sense of realism over and above that which would be experienced by 
observing a 2D image or even a 3D stereoscopic image with depth cues. 
Immersion of a human in an environment can provoke a kind of “suspension of 
disbelief” where the unreality is able to be ignored. Even though the world displayed 
is artiﬁcial, it is made to feel more real because the observer feels they are a partic-
ipant within it. Virtual environments can offer advantages in the design process 
and have been successfully used for the presentation and simulation of objects 
and spaces. Virtual environments are more efﬁcient at helping designers perceive 
volumes, spaces, and spatial relationships than in 2D environments [2]. 
Computer technology offers the user the capacity to hypothesize from the current 
situation and project into the future with millions of alternatives calculated in a 
fraction of a second. Artiﬁcial intelligence techniques can help in the selection of the 
ones likely to be the most interesting to perform interactive analysis on, that cannot 
be explored on a human time scale.

Case Study 1—European Project SynchroniCity 
“SynchroniCity” is an Internet of Things (IoT) project funded by the European 
Commission (2017–19) [3]. Its aim was to open up the market for IoT-enabled 
services for cities and communities where barriers prevented local economic and 
sustainable development. It identiﬁed where that the lack of standardized applica-
tion programming interfaces (APIs) made it difﬁcult to integrate new technologies 
into city services. The risk of ‘lock-in’ to systems deters large investments in smart 
city infrastructures and poses real challenges for local authorities and other city 
organizations. 
In response SynchroniCity developed a framework in the form of a set of tech-
nical mechanism that enabled local authorities and technology providers to easily 
exchange digital products, services and data [4]. The “Synchronicity Framework” is 
built around the Open and Agile Smart Cities (OASC) and Minimal Interoperability 
Mechanisms’ (MIMs), that together provide the technical foundation for deploy-
ment of IoT- and AI-enabled services for cities and communities. The MIMs are 
vendor-neutral and technology-agnostic and can be integrated with existing systems. 
This means that local authorities and technology providers to easily exchange digital 
products, services and data. 
The project involved 50 developments of products and services across 21 cities 
across Europe where pilots were SME-led groups. The foci of the pilot studies were 
as follows: citizen engagement, environment wellbeing, and sustainability.
58
R. Earnshaw and S. Liggett
Sustainable mobility was the focus of one of the pilots providing active travel 
insights in Antwerp, Helsinki and Manchester. Detailed understandings of cyclists, 
pedestrians and vehicle movements were made across the cities to promote green 
travel. The IoT solution combines data feeds from 3 different sensors, with compar-
ative open-air quality data provided by local authorities. Data from all sources was 
centralized in a dashboard and the following impact was achieved:
• 42 IoT devices were deployed.
• 98 existing IoT devices were connected.
• 111 datasets were consumed.
• 613 new datasets were generated.
• 158 open datasets were produced.
• The Technology Readiness Level of the team’s IoT solution improved from 6 to 
8. 
The pilots demonstrated that through using the framework: 
It is possible to transfer social and environmental impact to local economic activity, as well as 
opening new market opportunities for both local authorities and technology service providers 
[5]. 
What makes data most useful is not having the most advanced technical capabilities but 
lowering institutional barriers and identifying the problems that data can address [6]. 
Technology is evolving at an ever-increasing rate but all too often institutions and 
organizations and communities do not have easy access to cutting-edge products and 
services. Therefore, it is essential that technology providers develop hardware and 
software that does not have barriers to its use. Future-prooﬁng their IoT services is 
essential, and this can only be done by engaging with communities who use it and 
incorporate it into their business models. 
Case Study 2—i-MareCulture—Advanced VR, iMmersive Serious Games and 
Augmented Reality as Tools to Raise Awareness and Access to European 
Underwater Cultural Heritage 
i-MareCulture is a European project for digital heritage and virtual museums to raise 
public awareness of European identity by focusing on maritime cultural heritage. 
i-MareCulture aims to bring inherently inaccessible underwater cultural heritage to 
the public by implementing virtual visits, serious games with immersive technolo-
gies, and underwater augmented reality. Through the concept of the virtual museum, 
collaborative research from a range of different scientists, researchers, archeolo-
gists, experts and museums ancient sites, many that remain submerged or threatened 
are brought to life to bring public awareness to important archeological relics. Ten 
partners from central Europe are developing visualization approaches, and methods 
including virtual and augmented reality, to improve visibility and help to protect and 
preserve important archeological heritage. 
The project website has a number of tools and games that have been developed, and 
are open access to the public, including an image enhancement tool and a navigation 
algorithm. The enhancement tool implements ﬁve algorithms aimed at enhancing the
6

59
quality of underwater images that can automatically process a set of images within 
a directory. The navigation algorithm Seafaring Webservice, offers the user a visual 
simulation of Kyrenia’s ancient maritime paths based on real archeological data [7, 
8]. By raising awareness of important sites, the regional economic development will 
improve through tourism and an increased sense of local identity. 
Case Study 3—European Project VISTA AR 
VISTA AR (Visitor experience Innovation through Systematic Text Analytics & 
Augmented Reality) is a 4-year European Interreg (European Regional Development 
Fund) project which started in July 2017 and was extended to December 2021 due 
to the coronavirus pandemic. It aims to explore and improve visitor experiences for 
tourist attractions in the South of England and the North of France through creating 
new VR and AR digital tools. 
One site is Exeter Cathedral where virtual reality helmets, tablet and smartphone 
devices, and immersive room experiences were used to retell history through allowing 
visitors meet characters from the past and providing access to inaccessible heritage 
artifacts. The digital tools developed will create new digital experiences in further 
locations including the National Trust Tin Coast, East Pool mine and the South 
West Coast Path in the UK and in France at Fougères Castle, the Lorient Submarine 
Museum and the Gardens of Valloires [9]. 
The adoption of new technologies by artists and the increasing use of VR and AR 
as a medium for the production of artworks has stimulated a more detailed reﬂection 
on the processes of human creativity. Computer-assisted learning has prompted the 
study of pedagogy and human learning processes and models of artiﬁcial intelligence 
have initiated a more detailed examination of human intelligence [10–13]. 
With the increasing ubiquity of the digital environment there are new possibili-
ties for iterating ideas through different visual representations at a greater rate than 
was possible using previous manual methods. When data is held in digital form it 
is possible to run simulations and have virtual ‘walk-throughs’ which has proved 
particularly important in architectural design and also the design of 3D objects. 
With digital technology it is also possible to optimize the designs for situations 
where there are internal or external constraints, for example, in the total budget for 
the materials for a building, or construction costs, or in the implementation of an 
artwork. These include tools for design, mock-ups, real-time simulations, analysis 
of ﬁnal representations, and usability testing of ﬁnal conﬁgurations of objects, archi-
tectural spaces, and the environments which contain them. For example, designer 
Thomas Heatherwick’s 3d models and drawings of his architectural project “Vessel” 
the controversial architectural centerpiece for Hudsons Yard, New York, can be seen 
on his website [14]. The Heatherwick Studio recently replaced its CAD data manage-
ment system with Dassault Systèmes’, a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solu-
tion. This software is used to increase efﬁciency and reduce the amount of time spent 
on repetitive design tasks. This can enable more time can be spent by designers on 
the creative aspects of the projects [15]. 
Although physical 3D scale models gave previous generations of builders a good 
understanding of the structure of the building and how it would sit in its environment,
60
R. Earnshaw and S. Liggett
it was difﬁcult to fully understand how it would feel at full scale, particularly to a 
person moving from room to room inside the building. Therefore, it may be difﬁcult 
to fully envisage how far computers and associated technology will continue to 
transform the way information is processed, and the way we think about creating in 
the future. 
6.5 
New Media in Cyberworlds 
With the rise of new media and digital art forms there has been increasing scope for a 
wider variety of art objects, particularly those that are able to interact with audiences. 
Such interactions may change the artwork, or the perspective of the viewer, or both. 
In addition, time-based media such as video may be used in exhibitions either in 
free-standing mode, or be able to receive input from viewers to change the content of 
the video being displayed. A virtual exhibition can also be open to global audiences 
which can result in a sharing of cultural and ethical experiences across national and 
international boundaries. 
In 2018, Nottingham Contemporary hosted a virtual exhibition titled “House of 
Fame”, that was a novelty at the time allowing the viewer to move, rotate and zoom in 
the exhibits as if they were there in the gallery space [16]. Today, with the acceleration 
of the virtual experience as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic many galleries offer 
the experience of virtual exhibitions on their websites (e.g., https://v21artspace.com/ 
the-house-of-fame). 
This introduces the concept of exhibition spaces that are borderless with respect 
to time, space, and audiences [17, 18]. An artist who wishes to exhibit their work 
in this rapidly changing environment faces two principal challenges. The ﬁrst is to 
demonstrate the relevance of the art to today’s audiences and the rapidly changing 
environment. The second is to articulate forms of art which are capable of tran-
scending the boundaries of past traditions and demonstrate new horizons and new 
opportunities. We are ever-increasingly connected to one another and ever more 
accustomed to swiping our phones to access digital content. Digital technology can 
offer a greater level of interaction and increase knowledge and allow for richer 
experiences of culture if developed intelligently. 
Just before the pandemic in 2019 Innovate UK funded a research project at 
MOSTYN Gallery in Llandudno, North Wales to investigate how audiences want to 
interact with a public art gallery in the digital age [19]. Principal and co-investigators 
on the project Clare Harding and Mark Lochrie reﬂect on the impact of lockdowns 
and social distancing on the development of their engagement tools. They can use 
MOSTYN build tools to engage and connect audiences who may not be able to 
engage physically. These digital experiences can be even more attractive in an age of 
‘track and trace’, zoom parties, and with the use of QR codes to check in to venues. 
However, the sharing of the head mounted VR displays or wearables still present 
challenges for technologists, curators and audiences in galleries [20].

Case Study 4—EMAP European Media Art Platform 
The European Media Art Platform (EMAP) was created in 2018 to provide an inter-
national platform to promote and disseminate interdisciplinary art forms. It was 
believed that if Europe is to take a different technological path from China or Silicon 
Valley, it should concentrate on the creative potential of the arts.. Through the Euro-
pean Media Artist in Residence Exchange (EMARE) it enables partners to select 
artists and artwork for festivals and exhibitions to provide an international platform 
to disseminate their work. 
Rhone (2021) was an artwork by Gil Delindro stemming from a 6-month EMAP 
residency undertaken in La Becque, Switzerland. A video sound installation on the 
theme of the environment, global warming and geological sustainability, Rhone, 
explores the symbiotic relation between Glacier erosion and sedimentary geologic 
formation. The artist used a series of infrasound ﬁeld recordings and video stills 
captured in the Ice tunnels of the Rhone glacier over a period of three months. 
The Rhone was once the biggest Glacier of the Alps, being the main responsible for the 
geologic formation of Lac Leman and the surrounding alpine landscape. This project follows 
the connection between the retreating “Rhone Glacier” and “Genetti” - an industrial site that 
sits 100 kilometers after on the Rhone River [21]. 
Case Study 5—Cop26 Artists and Climate Change 
The UK hosted the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) 
in Glasgow in November 2021. Artists took the opportunity to participate in the 
conference with musician Brian Eno hosting a panel on how artists can respond to 
the climate emergency. Signiﬁcant works included a projected text piece by Jenny 
Holzer that quotes activist Greta Thunberg. Artist collective Still/Moving installed 
the artwork alongside the COP26 conference site. The work comprised a 70-m-long 
and six-meter-high artwork stating that there are ‘No New Worlds’ lit up in neon. 
Los Angeles based artist Beatie Wolfe projected her artwork From Green to Red 
onto the contemporary SEC Armadillo auditorium on the banks of the Clyde in 
Glasgow with the projection covering the entire facade of the building for the UN 
Climate Change Conference (COP26). The work visualizes rising levels of CO2 
in the atmosphere and is based on 800,000 years of NASA data that informs the 
interactive video installation by Wolfe. Technology allows artists to take impenetrable 
and intangible data by scientists and translate it into something they can engage with 
and absorb. 
Wolfe’s song accompanies the artwork acting as a giant music video to tell the 
story of the 50% rise in carbon in the atmosphere due to the activities of mankind. 
From Green To Red was produced in collaboration with world-renowned specialists 
in visual effects, creative production and immersive experiences The Mill and was 
premiered at the 2020 London Design Biennale [22].

Conclusions 
Virtual and augmented reality offer spaces which can enable participants to visit 
places as they were in the past and which are able to impart a real sense of actually 
being there. Where a historical site is a virtual reconstruction from archeological data, 
then this experience is facilitating a visit which would be impossible in the real world. 
This augmentation to real-world experience is both valuable and transformative, as 
well as being normative for the future. 
The affordances provided by the digital world generate new dimensions of connec-
tivity and communication that are particularly relevant in the context of this research. 
The digital environment can be an enabler in ways not initially envisaged. One 
example of digital affordances is the many to many paradigm established by the 
Internet. Networked communications override the one-to-many model used by broad-
casters and enable every communicator to be regarded as signiﬁcant and a contributor 
to the whole.

Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Creativity 
Rae Earnshaw and Susan Liggett 
Abstract Collaboration can increase creativity when the interactions are supportive 
and facilitative. In the real world this could be a group discussion or a collaboration 
on a particular artwork or project. The computer is increasingly in the loop on these 
collaborations because it can bring together both local and distant collaborators. In 
addition, the artwork or project can be displayed on computer screens and the partners 
can discuss it and work together in real-time. The computer program may also be able 
to make suggestions to the partners about design options, just as spell-checkers can 
make suggestions to authors about the grammar and spelling in an article or paper 
they are writing. The software works in the background and can add value to the 
overall process of creation, whether this is for a document or an artwork. In this case, 
the software is working according to pre-determined rules. If the program is allowed 
to modify itself by taking in input from its own processes, then the rules may change 
as the program is running. This may be useful in some situations but not in others. 
The increasing use of artiﬁcial intelligence techniques in science, technology, and 
the arts is reviewed and assessed, and the implications for creativity are presented.

Enhancing Creativity 
An art exhibition is a place where audiences meet works of art that are themselves a 
form of exposition. In the past, such exhibitions have been static and for a particular 
time-period and therefore had to be viewed by visitors within that time frame. They 
have also been mainly works of art such as pictures and drawings, sculptures, or 
installation art which contained various object components. For groups of people who 
have common interests, but no opportunity to meet due to geographical separation, 
online collaboration can provide new opportunities and new environments for sharing 
and creating. Art galleries are able to move from static displays ﬁxed in time and space 
to more ﬂexible virtual environments capable of attracting visitors on a global basis. 
They can also receive input from visitors from their interaction with the displays. 
This can provide feedback to the artists which could be useful in the creation of future

works. In addition, online interaction can provide the context for the development of 
collaborative art works and interactive exhibits. 
Liggett et al. [1] and Earnshaw et al. [2] detail projects which bring together artists, 
scientists, and social media in collaborative processes. It has been demonstrated that 
these collaborations deliver added value to all participants and enable research and 
development to proceed at a faster pace. 
Enhancing creativity may be accomplished by
• Increasing the diversity of the participants
• Providing anonymity
• Providing creativity triggers through illustrations of tangible products: 
– Prototype 
– Simulation 
– Storyboards 
– Mockups 
– Graphical presentations 
Carroll [3] explores whether and how creativity and rationale can have mutually 
facilitative interactions. Designs usually serve a particular purpose and conform 
to certain expectations and norms. Designs often open up new issues, raise new 
questions, and produce new understandings of esthetics. However, this can also create 
tension in contexts where creativity produces a signiﬁcant departure from the status 
quo, and where the effect on those who observe the design may be unpredictable.

Case Study—Ars Electronica 
Ars Electronica is an Austrian cultural, educational and scientiﬁc institute active in 
the ﬁeld of new media and has a focus on the relationship between art, technology 
and society. It runs an annual festival, and manages a multidisciplinary media arts 
R&D facility known as the Futurelab that is guided by the question of what new tech-
nologies mean for our lives. Together with artists, scientists, developers, designers, 
entrepreneurs and activists, explore current developments in the digital society and 
speculate about their manifestations in the future. The key question is “not what 
technology can or will be able to do, but always what it should do for us” [4]. Ars 
Elecronica has a focus of our artistic research and its European ARTiﬁcial Intelligence 
Lab (AI Lab) has Residency program with #Residency 7 awarded to Anna Ridler 
(GB) and Caroline Sinders (US) for their project ‘AI isn’t Artiﬁcial but Human’ in 
partnership with the Edinburgh International Festival. 
Anna Ridler is a UK based artist and researcher who was listed in 2018 by Artnet 
as one of nine “pioneering artists” exploring AI’s creative potential. She is interested 
in working with collections of information, particularly self-generated data sets, to 
create new and unusual narratives in a variety of mediums, and what happens when 
things cannot ﬁt into discrete categories. She is currently interested in the intersection
7

of machine learning and nature and what we can learn from history. Her artwork 
“Mosaic Virus” is a video work produced by an artiﬁcial intelligence and shows a 
ﬂowering tulip whose appearance is controlled by the price of a Bitcoin. In this piece, 
the stripes and colors depend on the value of the Bitcoin and change over time to 
show how the market ﬂuctuates, and also draw historical parallels from the “tulip 
mania” that swept across the Netherlands in the 1630s to the current speculation on 
crypto-currencies. A major part of the project was to create a dataset of 10,000 tulips, 
all categorized by hand to reveal the human aspect behind machine learning [5]. 
Caroline Sinders is a US machine learning artist and researcher whose work 
explores the intersections between natural language processing, artiﬁcial intelligence, 
abuse, online harassment, and politics in digital, conversational spaces. Caroline 
Sinders’s artwork. “Feminist Data Set” (Fig. 7.1) investigates what it means to think 
through machine learning, to examine every step of the process through a feminist 
lens, carefully considering every aspect of production, iteration and design. The 
project carried out data collection in educational and community-based workshops 
which was then developed to create a feminist data labeling and training system and 
a data labeling product [6]. 
“The Feminist Data Set” is an artistic and critical design multi-year project that 
queries each step of the AI process. It includes

data collection, data labeling, data training, selection of an algorithm to be used, the algo-
rithmic model, and then the design of how the model is placed in a chat bot (and what 
the chat bot looks like). Each step exists to challenge and analyse the pipeline of machine 
learning – is each step feminist, is it intersectional, does each step have a bias and how can 
this bias be removed? [7]. 
Sinders found that it evident that the required tool, namely a feminist intervention, 
does not yet exist and therefore needs to be created and the ﬁnal result of the project 
once complete will be a feminist chat bot [5]. 
“There is so much that we do not yet see, so much that is still hidden; no one really 
knows where the digital revolution will take us” Hannes Leopoldseder (1940–2021), 
co-founder of Ars Electronica [8]. 
7.3 
Computational Creativity 
Deﬁning the process of analysis to enable it to be done automatically by a computer 
requires the deﬁnition of the key parameters. The use of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) 
techniques may provide a degree of augmentation of human capability and present 
new options and possibilities not conceived of initially by the human mind. This raises 
the question of in what sense could a machine be described as having creativity? In 
what sense would this relate to human creativity? If one of the objectives of Google’s 
acquisition of DeepMind in 2014 was to improve the capability of machines to be 
able to think more like humans, then it will be interesting to see how far computers 
are able to produce creative solutions to current challenges and problems in order to 
go beyond what humans are currently able to do [9]. Clearly one of the advantages 
is direct access to the world’s information in Google’s databases in forms other 
than searching for a match to a query. Knowing the right question to ask is often a 
large part of the problem space. If the question is not known in advance, can new 
applications of Google’s databases provide new and innovative ideas derived from 
the current information that has been collected and stored? The issue of whether 
machines could surpass the capabilities of humans is an ongoing debate [10]. 
Boden proposes [11] that AI techniques can be used to create new ideas in three 
ways as follows: 
1. By producing novel combinations of familiar ideas 
2. By exploring the potential of conceptual spaces 
3. By making transformations that enable the generation of previously impossible 
ideas. 
In addition, models of AI and creativity and their applications, can offer insights 
into creativity itself. This is similar to the ways in which computer-assisted learning 
has provided new insights into human learning by acting as a reﬂector back to the 
human. It may be regarded as a by-product of the fundamental aim of a computer-
directed process, which could be seen as a way to perform a process faster, more 
economically, or with greater efﬁciency and effectiveness. In addition, this learning
7
Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Creativity
69
process can also be more personalized and adapted to the particular needs and require-
ments of the individual. By analogy, a computer-directed creative process can be 
tuned to a particular individual circumstance. From this comparison it can be seen 
that there is signiﬁcant potential in exploring how AI can assist the creative process, 
and in some cases modify it to produce a new and unexpected outcome, or set of 
outcomes (the third in Boden’s three ways listed above). 
Computer-assisted creativity usually involves implementing a set of rules or proce-
dures which a human would follow if the process were to be done manually. This 
offers the advantage of speed and efﬁciency in generating outcomes. However, it 
also offers the possibility of amending the rules and observing what changes in the 
outcome(s) are produced. This can be extended further to the interactive modiﬁca-
tion of the rules in real-time in order to generate a series of possible outcomes, from 
which an optimum outcome may be selected. However, the real gains can come when 
the rules are much more ﬂexible, and the computer is allowed to modify the rules 
internally. In this case, the user may deﬁne a possible starting point and the computer 
is then free to generate further points, and also new rules which the user may not 
have thought of beforehand. 
Bostrom [12] raises concerns about the prospect of ‘superintelligence’ and what 
its implications might be for human society as a whole if there are insufﬁcient controls 
on initial conditions and potential outcomes. 
7.4 
Case Study—Deep Mind Technologies Developments 
Deep Mind’s objective is to produce general-purpose learning algorithms using 
machine learning and systems neuroscience. Such algorithms can be utilized in a 
wide variety of applications unlike earlier chess playing programs (such as IBM’s 
Deep Blue) which were tailored to a particular environment and to achieving a pre-
deﬁned goal. These new algorithms were tested in a variety of applications involving 
games, where clearly human creativity plays a role. Game play is a complex test-bed 
which is able to evaluate the power of the algorithms. This is because one move at a 
particular point on the game can have far-reaching implications subsequently. This 
raises the issue of the optimum move now for the best of a set of possible outcomes in 
the future. How can a new move be arrived at that has not been played before? This 
kind of “out-of-the-box” thinking could characterize a human making this move. 
Can the algorithm improve on this for a wide range of possible moves? The game 
may have well-deﬁned rules but if the player is in a new situation they have not seen 
before, what move do they make when they do not intuitively know the outcome? 
An algorithm that can learn how to play the game faster and better than a human will 
be likely to make better decisions when in a new situation. 
Deep Mind’s AlphaGo program was better than the world champion human 
professional Go player in 2016 [13]. Another program, AlphaZero, was superior 
to the best programs playing go, chess, and shogi after a short period of learning the 
games [14]. In science, Deep Mind has made considerable progress in addressing 
the difﬁcult problem of protein folding [15].

Conclusions 
Factors affecting the digital future include the increasing use of artiﬁcial intelli-
gence techniques to handle routine transactions or information requests, as well 
as new applications and objects; immersive and augmented reality interfaces, and 
advanced analytic techniques. All these are likely to generate further developments 
and applications in the digital world and offer opportunity for participation and 
change.

Art Thinking and Design Thinking 
Jill Townsley 
Abstract A broader spectrum of creative practice is considered more closely, distin-
guishing between art and design as different entities within the creative tradition. 
Drawing distinctions between these two forms, could help us understand creativity 
with more breadth. Creativity may be classiﬁed across two domains in the visual 
arts, art thinking and design thinking. This distinction has a long tradition, however, 
research outside of practice-based analysis has introduced it as a multidisciplinary 
tool. Art thinking has in this way expanded beyond art practice and is applied as a 
general method for observing and utilizing patterns, in all types of creative activities.

Introduction 
A simple example or case study, ‘Till Rolls’ (Townsley), offers a situation where 
analog problems, revealed through art thinking (the process of making) are solved 
using design thinking and digital technology. 
Artist and researcher, Hideaki Ogawa investigates art thinking in his work at 
FutureLab, a research stream at Ars Electronica; the Austrian cultural, educational, 
and scientiﬁc institute. He asks: what is the role of art in the twenty-ﬁrst century? 
and how may it be applied for the beneﬁt of our future societies? To help answer this 
he makes a binary distinction between creativity in art and design: 
Art creates creative questions and design creates the creative solutions [1]. 
Ogawa’s proposition re-deﬁnes a long-acknowledged contrast between art and 
design; by addressing creativity as a form of thinking, leading to two distinctly 
different outcomes. Analyzing the differences and similarities between these two 
disciplines could identify important breadth across the single term creativity. Such 
distinctions may also indicate how collaboration may contribute toward more diverse 
and complete creative outcomes. This knowledge is then applied to consider how 
creativity may develop across the digital and analog world.

8.2 
Design Thinking 
Ogawa outlines the considerable strength of design thinking to inﬂuence the world 
we live in, by providing solutions to problems, resulting in products and services that 
help navigate existence (Fig. 8.1). 
Design Thinking is effective for creating and shaping creative solutions for the future [1]. 
The closeness of design thinking to productivity is clear, design evolves the 
creative solutions, understanding and utilizing possibilities in order to produce 
products and services. 
Design thinking as a creative method became a ubiquitous term in the 1990s, 
to describe the practical, cognitive, and strategic processes involved in developing 
design proposals. These processes include, context analysis and framing, ideation 
and solution generating, creative thinking, sketching and drawing, modeling, and 
prototyping and testing. They also involve evaluating ill-deﬁned problems with solu-
tion focused strategies, and as such has often been an oversimpliﬁed route proxy for 
creative thinking [2]. 
However, Design Thinking is deﬁned differently by different authors. 
Brown (2008) deﬁnes it as “a discipline that uses the designer’s sensibility and methods 
to match people’s needs with what is technologically feasible and what a viable business 
strategy can convert into customer value and market opportunity [3] 
and Leidtka and Ogilvie [4] frame design as “a systematic approach to problem 
solving. It starts with customers and the ability to create a better future for them”. 
The concept of artistic interventions has an inclusive deﬁnition by Berthoin Antal 
bringing in people, practices, and products from the arts to help address issues their 
organizations are facing [5]. 
Design thinking has been criticized by Bruce Nussbaum [6] among others for its 
textbook methodology that promises quick ﬁxes for organizations at the expense of

75
genuine creativity. Critics argue that design thinking has stripped out the messiness 
of the creative process when conﬂict, failure, emotions, and constant repetition is at 
the very heart of the creative process. Through focusing only on what the user wants, 
there is a signiﬁcant risk that we may not be asking the right questions. 
8.3 
Art Thinking 
Art Thinking on the other hand, is a much more dispersed activity, adept at raising 
creative questions, at looking at problems from different angles to deﬁne a landscape 
and propose new strategies and approaches toward the future. 
Well established forms of critical thinking are key to discovering creativity in art 
thinking. Creativity developed with critical understanding, supports creative artwork 
that has contextual resonance. The aim is not to offer deﬁnitive conclusions or 
answers but to raise questions and to bring into some focus the ever-changing cultural 
landscape. This complexity is deﬁned by Ogawa 
Art is a catalyst for shaping a better future society, a way to open up new perspectives, 
encourage curiosity to look at what is behind the scenes and to stimulate creative solutions. 
Art Thinking is a process of applying artistic thinking and an artful view to a broader range 
of challenges [7]. 
With this statement Ogawa acknowledges that the creativity embedded within the 
art object can be very different to a design object (Fig. 8.2). Creativity engaged in 
art thinking often deals with conjecture, presenting multiple viewpoints, sometimes 
simultaneously, posing fuzzy questions and offering incomplete possibilities.

sions

J. Townsley
This creativity produces cultural collateral whose aim is not determinative or 
‘smart’, often placed not to solve speciﬁc questions, but grow them. This is a risky 
place for an economic system that predominantly searches for solutions, where 
success is to cultivate the investment in wealthy returns. For the artist, this form 
of creativity usually engages contextual referencing, indicating the conceptual land-
scape the artwork intends to engage with. Successful communication of this open 
form is completed by the viewer, with the professional critic playing a signiﬁcant 
role, placing art thinking within a socially contextual and cultural milieu. 
The creative reach of art thinking (the ability of the art object to engage large 
numbers of people) is difﬁcult to predict, as its success depends on its contextual 
position within society, including the space and time of its encounter. Through art 
thinking, creativity can be activated in a way that can be shared within society, 
from origin to reception, referenced through culture, and relational to the social 
engagement of people. Relational engagement can draw people together socially 
across time and space, even traveling across cultural differences. Creativity here is 
operating in a most powerful and often unpredictable manner, it is often referred to 
as ‘soft power’ [8], having the ability to co-opt rather than coerce. 
8.4 
Case Study ‘Till Rolls’—Art Thinking Collaborating 
with Design Thinking 
In 2008, the Towner Contemporary art gallery in Eastbourne, commissioned a 
large-scale installation for an exhibition named ‘Compulsive, Obsessive, Repetitive’ 
(2011). At the beginning, the installation was proposed as a creative concept, its 
existence was potential, on paper only, and it was proposed three years ahead of the 
gallery’s opening, even before the gallery building was constructed. 
Till Rolls (Fig. 8.3) is a temporary sculptural installation, conceived to stand on a 
gridded footprint 5.7 m square, and reaching a height of 3 m at its highest point. It 
was made only from tightly packed rolls of paper, 10,000 of them. The paper rolls 
are manufactured for use in shop tills (cash machines) to store accounts and print 
receipts. It is a simple mechanism to record countless human interactions around 
trade, cataloging the exchange of goods for money. Each till roll occupied its own 
space on the ﬂoor in a grid system, 100 rows long and 100 rows wide (Fig. 8.4). 
To form the sculpture, the center of each till roll was extruded, lifted into the space 
above the grid. At different heights each till roll contributed to a rolling landscape, 
a three-dimensional graph conﬁguring the hills and valleys of the space above the 
grid.
To construct Till Rolls in the gallery space presented speciﬁc contingent problems. 
The installation time was to be only 4 days, allowing no opportunity for reﬂexive 
thinking within the creative process. These are important decisions on shape and 
form, art thinking traditionally solved in the privacy of the studio, through trial and 
error, and within the execution of the work. In this case, creative judgments must be

addressed prior to the making process, while still at the proposal stage. A strategy 
was needed to ensure that the work would fulﬁll a speciﬁc pre-conceived structure 
and could be built in the short timeframe. Such problems often require collaboration 
across other disciplines such as engineering, science, or technology, requiring the 
skills of design thinking. 
8.5 
Design Thinking in Till Rolls 
The next phase of Till Rolls offers a good example of simple collaborative creativity 
located within design thinking, employed to solve speciﬁc problems arising from art 
thinking. The design questions were: 
1. How to build the work in only four days, considering the time it takes to manually 
extrude each of the 10,000 till rolls? 
2. How to identify the height of each till roll and where to place it correctly within 
the sculpture’s gridded footprint, so that the correct pre-conceived shape of the 
whole installation could be realized? 
3. How to empower a team of gallery assistants to work independently to construct 
the sculpture.

Dr. Unver was able to see that digital 3D polygon modeling tools could offer useful 
creative solutions [9]. The digital space has the advantage of providing a virtual place 
for creative comparison across potential outcomes. It enabled the artist to make crit-
ical and creative decisions toward realizing the ﬁnal shape of the installation. These 
are fundamental decisions integral to sculptural practice. Using digital technology 
in this way formed a bridge between design thinking; to solve the concrete problem, 
and art thinking; enabling appropriate creative possibilities for the future sculptural 
form. 
Once decisions about the ﬁnal shape of the work were made, the polygon modeling 
program was able to capture the digital information in a way that could be recon-
ﬁgured (Fig. 8.5a). The whole digital sculpture was then cut into 100 slices which 
allowed the height and position of each of the 10,000 till rolls to be plotted onto two-
dimensional graphs. Each graph, once printed, could be used as a map for construction 
in the gallery. The graph offered the location of each till roll along the bottom axis,

while the vertical axis plotted its height in centimeters. This resulted in 100 graphs 
collectively articulating a ﬂoorplan for the whole work and helping to systemize the 
process of construction (Fig. 8.5b). 
The graphs enabled a changing group of artists assistance, gallery volunteers and 
community groups, to work independently across each row, with the conﬁdence that 
each till roll was extruded to the right height to form the sculpture, and then placed 
in the correct spot on the ﬂoor of the gallery (Fig. 8.6).

An important outcome from collaboration, across design and art thinking, was 
that this temporary artwork was organized with a procedural method that could be 
accurately repeated. Offering opportunities for the work to be rebuilt in different 
galleries and contexts (Venice Arsenale, Washington DC, Huddersﬁeld Art Gallery). 
The virtual object realized through a collaboration of art and design thinking, 
offered space for critical analysis pertinent to both art and design procedures. It 
also provided the systematic procedure for the construction of the work with artist, 
designer, digital specialist, gallery assistance, and public volunteers, all having an 
individual role within the authorship of the sculptural installation (Figs. 8.7a, b, and 
8.8).

Design Thinking and Art Thinking in the Technological 
Space 
While the difference between art thinking and design thinking as deﬁned by Ogawa 
is clear, there is also a coming together of art and design especially evident in digital 
technology. There are many creative examples of contemporary artists expanding 
their studios to include designers and artists working together. Technology companies 
have also expanded to broaden their skills to include both artists and designers with 
an understanding that each offer different forms of creativity. 
Art thinking created the ﬁrst iPhone; design thinking made it a manufacturable, cultural 
phenomenon [3].

In Ogawa’s model the value of creativity in design is its preoccupation with 
problem solving, in contrast to creative artistic interventions that are concerned with 
problem ﬁnding. This makes the discourses of creativity within technology subtly 
different too, with the separation between them not clearly deﬁned in the single term. 
John Lasseter, formerly chief creative ofﬁcer at Pixar, and now head of animation at 
Skydance Animation, describes the equation this way: “Technology inspires art, and 
art challenges the technology” [10]. 
To understand how to improve new products, feedback and critique is necessary, 
and this is where artistic thinking can help, as Jobs points out this happens very often 
across traditional disciplines. 
It’s in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough—it’s technology married with 
liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing 
[11]. 
Art and design students practice critique often deﬁned by the humanities or 
socially through worldly experience that enables them to develop their creative work. 
This connects them to a cultural context, a relational world that is always changing, 
always inﬁnitely complex. 
8.7 
Conclusions 
One way to address how creativity may operate across the analog and digital divide 
in the future, is to look at the way visual arts and artists engage different forms of 
creativity across different visual art disciplines today. The aim is to consider how 
creative process can generate social justice and produce cultural value [12]. 
Deﬁning creativity as distinctly different in its action when applied across design 
or art practice is a useful tool to analyze. It is also relevant to understand how creativity 
supports critical thinking, and even how it can drive cultural change. 
Ogawa provides us with a deeper understanding of the forms of creativity that may 
be appropriated, through collaborative means, to realize and construct contemporary 
artwork. While creativity is known to be integral to all artistic endeavor, artists are also 
increasingly collaborating with other disciplines to broaden the forms of creativity 
available to them. This enables artists to develop artwork ﬁt for our highly inter-
faced and conceptually broad contemporary contexts. Often this produces artwork 
that can interact with technological development to help deﬁne our societal selves. 
Creativity can investigate our relationship to external and conceptual systems, such 
as time, temporality and how we experience creative communication from source to 
interpretation through reception. 
The next chapter deals with contextual referencing and its ﬂuidity within socially 
agreed cultural systems.

Time and Temporality: Creative 
Reception and Repetition 
Jill Townsley 
Abstract Spoons is a sculpture that holds contextual reference through its relation to 
time. Temporality is made visible as the sculpture randomly collapses in the gallery 
space over a period of time. It looks at the way time and temporality interact with 
creativity to bring meaning to an artwork. A proposition is made that meaning is 
constructed through a process of relational connection between the artwork and the 
viewer. Communication and meaning are contingent on an ever-changing interaction 
between origin and reception. This is a creative act, and as such meaning is creative 
and contingent on the time and the temporality of the moment of encounter. However, 
moments are always changing, so, meaning is always changing too, as time alters 
our socially agreed cultural contexts, interests, and concerns. The proposition is that 
through art thinking, creativity becomes a social event, constructed between origin 
and reception, ﬂuid and relationally positioned in time and space through repetition. 
The case study reveals that meaning can be creative and transient, as opposed to 
speciﬁc or ﬁxed, and that these creative constructs depend on time, culturally agreed 
contexts, and relational conditions. Consideration is also given to how the digital 
space can disrupt our understanding of time and temporality, as it traverses the analog 
and digital worlds.

Introduction 
Large and temporary installations, such as Till Rolls, exist only during the ﬂeeting 
moment of their construction. They present visual art as an event which is received in 
time, as opposed to an art object as a more permanent artifact. The temporal nature 
of this form of practice offers the opportunity to move away from the traditional 
materials of painting or sculpture often chosen for their strength and stability for the 
future. Stone or oil paint tend to create immutable objects in a ﬁxed or memorial 
space. In the twentieth century a new tradition evolved, using temporary materials 
or processes, sometimes even presenting their own decline. This is evident from 
auto destructive art (Metzger 1960s) to art practices that sit closer to time-based

events such as happenings (Kaprow 1960s). The use of ﬁlm or video has allowed 
for documentation beyond the temporality of these works. This permits temporary 
artwork to evolve and sit alongside other time-based creative disciplines, such as 
theater, dance, and the screen. 
In an age of easily replicable technology and digital documentation, photography, 
and video, including the new non-fungible token (NFT), the repetition of a live event 
or singular object is now possible. This offers re-presentation through time and 
place. In this way, repeat viewing can shift from an original encounter, into an ever-
expanding range of settings, and across many timeframes. The digital format which 
can be accessed through the camera and screen, offers an alternative technological 
place. This has extended the possibility of the object beyond its materiality or time-
limited contingency (however long). Objects contingent on time and space can now 
offer future inﬂuence, beyond the moment of their existence. This is made possible 
by digital means. 
9.2 
Case Study Spoons—Temporality, and Art Thinking 
Spoons is a sculptural artwork that was created in the digital and analog worlds 
simultaneously (Fig. 9.1). The period of its existence as an object is transient. It is 
made to collapse and exist only in the moment of its multiple constructions. However, 
the video documentation of the very ﬁrst collapse is always replicable, accessed 
through video documentation, and published online and periodically available in 
gallery exhibitions.
The sculpture consists of a large pyramid standing 2.5 m high. It is made from 9273 
plastic spoons and 3091 rubber bands. The latticework of the pyramid is constructed 
by tessellating tripod shaped, repeated units, consisting of three plastic spoons tied 
together with a rubber band (Fig. 9.2).
The pyramid is delicately balanced, with each tripod unit offering structural 
support, all working to realize the complete form. However, over time the rubber 
bands that hold the tripods together rot and break, resulting in the whole sculp-
ture experiencing a random decay. As the pyramid collapses, the materials return 
from components in a sculpture to the original plastic spoons and rubber (Figs. 9.3 
and 9.4).
Originally created in 2008, the ﬁrst material collapse was recorded with time-
lapse video, capturing one frame every 20 min over four months. Each time the 
sculpture is rebuilt for exhibition this original video is shown alongside the newly 
formed pyramid. Presenting the digital documentation of a past event, alongside the 
analog present. This offers a comparison of differences over time. Viewers can read 
between the video documentation of the original collapse, and the live moment of a 
decaying sculpture. The formula for the creative object is always the same, the same 
number of spoons, the same number of rubber bands, the same process of construc-
tion, and yet the same event can never be replicated through time. Each presen-
tation of collapse is different, and each creative moment is experienced differently.

This difference is also accentuated by the different timeframes held within the digital 
and analog presentation. A hyper-real digital video can show a speeded-up collapse 
by presenting only one frame every 20 min, and also the real-time, slow collapse of 
the analog sculpture. 
9.3 
Art Thinking Meets Contextual Thinking in Time 
To identify art thinking within Spoons we may, (though not exclusively) take directly 
from its material form. The materials themselves, multiple, mass-produced, low value 
plastic and rubber objects, have cultural currency beyond their original appropriation. 
They have obvious economic, and process reference, and for that reason have some 
inﬂuence over what may be considered a creative communication or meaning. The 
idea of meaning here is a difﬁcult one, the object of art is not didactic. The artwork was 
not conceived as a place for a factual statement, but a space for creative discussion. 
The nature of that creative conversation is also never ﬁxed, it is transient, existing in an 
ever-changing context through repeated reception, time, and the relational inﬂuence 
of any current cultural concerns of the viewer. 
In 2008, during a time of economic collapse, Spoons featured within the context of 
the exhibition, Second Lives Remixing the Ordinary, at the opening of the Museum 
of Art and Design in New York. Along with other artifacts in this curated group 
exhibition it instigated discussions of process collapse, including Fordism, appro-
priation, reappropriation, and renewal. Over time and through later reconstructions, 
the meanings assigned to Spoons have changed and the contextual references have 
shifted, and the understandings are different. 
Potential references for Spoons today capture more broadly the ecological dangers 
of cheap multiple plastic objects; from the toxicity of their production, to their 
microplastic inﬂuences on animal and plant eco-culture. The work is now exhib-
ited in group exhibitions that speciﬁcally curate these concerns, e.g., Plastic Matter 
exhibition (2020) at the Art and Design Gallery, University of Hertfordshire. This 
curated exhibition emphasized that a link between our climate catastrophe and our 
means of production has become more collectively understood. Statistical evidence 
has consolidated our understanding of the negative environmental consequences of 
human production. Consequentially the work has drawn some equivalence between 
an increasing environmental context and the social relationship to mass produced 
goods, processes, and objects. 
This new context also activates meaning for the random collapse of the pyramidal 
object, where comparisons can be drawn between the structural collapse and our own 
human footprint as transient, both individually, and collectively. This understanding 
is possible despite our culturally agreed understanding of the pyramid as a symbol 
of stability and longevity, contextually referenced through historic or memorial site 
(e.g., Egyptian pyramids) and the conceptually complete regular solid presented in 
mathematical theory.
90
J. Townsley
These two implications for Spoons, compared across two group exhibitions in 
2008 and 2020, offer distinctly different potential meaning, if indeed references 
can be identiﬁed as meaning? What is clear however, is that these two exam-
ples separated by time present creativity in relation to socially-based contextual 
and cultural concerns. Art thinking is prominent, but this work does not answer 
questions or fulﬁll ﬁxed needs. Its inﬂuence is signiﬁcant only through the type of 
creative cultural connections that Ogawa outlines [1]. Understanding is contextually 
referenced through critical thinking and reﬂection. For this reason, the references 
are transient, and meanings are always changing over time, through moments of 
encounter and reception, positioned relationally to each viewers individual context, 
and collective social concerns. 
9.4 
Creativity—Reception and Repetition 
There is a wealth of philosophical documentation around reception theories, espe-
cially in relation to literary text, where the analysis of communication models 
provided a space for the readers creative interpretation. This needs to be acknowl-
edged. Stuart Hall ascertained that ideas are’encoded’ through text (and other means) 
then ‘decoded’ by the reader or receiver of the creative form. 
Traditionally, mass-communications research has conceptualized the process of commu-
nication in terms of a circulation circuit or loop. This model has been criticized for its 
linearity—sender/message/receiver—for its concentration on the level of message exchange 
and for the absence of a structured conception of the different moments as a complex struc-
ture of relations. But it is also possible (and useful) to think of this process in terms 
of a structure produced and sustained through the articulation of linked but distinctive 
moments—production, circulation, distribution/consumption, reproduction [2]. 
This understanding further indicates that the creative form is not ﬁxed. Hall goes 
on to categorize how a text may be received, and outlines differences, through cultural 
proﬁling and collective cultural forces. An upload download model of creative 
communication can never produce a repeat of a singular original, as a ‘loop’. Each 
viewer receives the information in a way particular to themselves, individual re-
presentation happens. The categories posited by Hall (the dominant, oppositional, 
or negotiated reading) offer a general way of thinking through this complex creative 
relation (between art object and viewer). This is a relational and creative communi-
cation no longer binary in form. The possibilities are inﬁnite and in constant ﬂux, 
due largely to the impossibility of repetition. 
There are also questions arising when thinking about creative communication as 
a binary encode and download structure, despite an understanding that repetition 
can never offer a singular object or event. This model is much more aligned with 
design thinking, it is determinative and direct, it meets a need for stable communica-
tion. It remains untouched by aspects of transient cultural constructions of meaning 
reﬂecting human relational complexity.

Time and Temporality: Creative Reception and Repetition
91
9.5 
The Digital Context and Repetition 
In the digital space the terms encoding, and decoding have a much more concrete 
relation with repetition. Repetition is possible through the replication of the digital 
form, in perfect repeat (glitches aside) from one digital ﬁle to another, making the 
digital source much more constant through the process of repeatability. Meanwhile 
the variant of human reception, through re-presentation or repeat observation, is 
still always changing, always transient. Multiplicity as outlined by Hall is clearly 
operating, despite the digital space having more control over repetition. Offering 
the original repeatedly is still open to constant change through repeat reception over 
time. 
The vast possibility of singular relational creative outcomes brought about through 
the multiplicity of reception, has some similarity to Walter Benjamin’s theory of 
repetition [3] referring to the new technologies of print reproduction booming in 
the early nineteenth century. Benjamin observed the egalitarian and more general 
access to printed material, cutting through the strata of cultural privilege. However, 
he simultaneously lamented the lack of direct lines of communication from author to 
viewer (or reader) brought about through access to the original, the singular creative 
object. Benjamin perceived objects of creation, replicated in print, as changing their 
creative state. In the process they were undergoing a loss of ‘aura’, or closeness to 
the authors human creative origins, something only available through the singular 
object. In Benjamin’s construct, something is lost or becomes less powerful, as it 
moves away from the singular source and the body of the artist, altered through 
technological repetition. 
Digital replication is at source constant in a way that print could never be. But 
whether we are thinking about the replication of a printed image or a digital image, all 
become unstable in their communication with the analog world, through reception, 
this is always a creative space. 
Multiplicity here becomes a tool of creative re-generation. In Spoons that multi-
plicity also operates in many ways; there is the multiplicity of the material, the 
process form of the structure, the multiple failures of the materials (rubber bands) 
that instigate a failure of the singular pyramidal form and its ultimate collapse. We 
also have structural failure operating across video and analog settings. However, 
with each collapse there is a regeneration, as the sculpture is rebuilt, or the video 
is looped. But ﬁnally, more powerful in its generative power is the communication 
between viewer and object, this never completes, but is always re-generative. 
In Spoons all these repeated processes happen over time, material, reception, and 
in analog and digital spaces. All are opportunities for contextual reference toward 
identifying a creative meaning for this work. Meaning that is not static but changes 
in relation to repeat viewing, material state, and across the digital-analog divide, and 
referenced within a collective relational and cultural setting, resulting in multiple 
creative destinations.

9.6 
Socialized Time 
The idea that creativity can be collectively authored in culture, realized in permanent 
ﬂux, ever-changing and ever-emerging, has some resonance with Henri Bergson’s 
theory of durée: “Bergson’s culture is socialised time actualised in experienced 
duration or durée—culture is always in motion” [4]. He argues against thinking about 
components quantitively, and advocates that change is experiential and intuitive, 
socialized time, experienced through the body, “in social experience—in short an 
embodied conception of culture” (ibid.). 
he argues for a view of time as qualitative; intuition as situated within experience rather than 
about it (ibid.). 
Bergson also uses the material characteristics of an elastic band as a metaphor. 
He talks about an elastic band being stretched, as an illustration to interrogate what 
may be understood as duration. 
Bergson tells us ﬁrst to contract the band to a mathematical point, which represents “the 
now” of our experience. Then, draw it out to make a line growing progressively longer. He 
warns us not to focus on the line but on the action which traces it. If we can focus on the 
action of tracing, then we can see that the movement — which is duration — is not only 
continuous and differentiating or heterogeneous, but also indivisible (ibid). 
In the process of Spoons the breaks are literal, the rubber bands snap, causing the 
pyramid to collapse. This is perhaps equivalent to ‘the now of our experience’. This 
is the moment of ‘snap’. However, it is the slow decay of the pyramid that better 
represents duration, the act of tracing from the complete pyramid to piles of spoons 
landing on the ﬂoor. Most importantly that duration is played out in different ways in 
the digital video, time speeded as one frame every 20 min into a condensed animation 
of time. A speeded-up simulacra of the real time slow duration decay of the analog 
sculpture. 
While Bergson’s visual metaphor has material reference with Spoons, through 
the rubber band, he is clear that for him no image can truly represent duration, “An 
image is immobile, while duration is ‘pure mobility’” [5]. However, if we were to 
apply the concept of duration to the communication between Spoons and audience 
reception or experience, we are getting much closer to durée. There is an invisible 
space offered through encountering the art object, which could also be considered 
qualitative and descriptive of pure mobility. 
Let us take our mind off the space subtending the movement and concentrate solely on the 
movement itself, on the act of tension or extension, in short, on pure mobility. This time we 
shall have a more exact image of our development in duration [6]. 
The art object is offering interpretation through reception to the viewer and so 
forming a relational position within the complex cultural contexts positioned within 
a milieu of creative possibilities. Socialized time makes creative interpretations have 
mobility and duration beyond a ﬁxed moment, allowing mobility of meaning to 
‘stretch’ beyond any singular origin. Through reception the object is much more

93
broadly durational, as meanings shift through time and space. These encounters are 
relational, forming creative meaning through a culture that is always in motion. 
9.7 
Conclusion 
Art thinking embodied in the art object is by its very nature positioned within a 
broader context, linking across multiple destinations and transformative through 
time, and situation. This may produce a transient object; capable of raising questions 
of life from within, always re-drawn through critical contextual reference to time in 
the present. The lack of focus on destination is positively habituated toward offering 
outcomes that are less totalitarian in reception or ﬁxed in meaning. Allowing space 
for the viewer in visual art terms (listener in music terms et cetera) to complete 
the authorship through reception. This can result in a more diverse creative milieu, 
forming a creative space between origin and reception that can initiate and raise 
debate. 
Creativity located in art thinking does not always mean that we are all nudged 
toward the same conclusion or even the same destination. Instead, creativity in art 
thinking can be inclusive and embrace complexity. Reﬂection through creative art 
thinking can identify differences in understanding or thought from within, enabling 
us to perceive ourselves as individual yet connected to a greater whole. In relational 
terms, creativity employed in art thinking is always subject to community, society, 
and context. The opportunity to question perceptive norms, or societal structures, 
even help identify self within a community, is adding to a relational understanding, 
across time, space, subject, and experience.

How Can Art Assist Science 
and Technology? 
Rae Earnshaw 
Abstract Art and science both involve creation and imagination and have been 
closely linked from the beginning of civilization. Activities during the Egyptian 
Kingdoms and the Greek world in both art and science have been preserved and 
reﬂect substantial achievements in design, form, and esthetics. The systematization 
of knowledge resulted in divisions between the disciplines which has taken time to 
understand and resolve. The contribution of art to the computer age is exempliﬁed in 
the role of the data visualization artist, who now assist in the extraction of meaningful 
results from very large data sets. Artists have also used these complex images for 
their own artworks and exhibitions.

Introduction 
Art may be deﬁned as follows: 
Art is generally understood as any activity or product done by people with a communicative 
or aesthetic purpose—something that expresses an idea, an emotion or, more generally, a 
world view. It is a component of culture, reﬂecting economic and social substrates in its 
design. It transmits ideas and values inherent in every culture across space and time. Its role 
changes through time, acquiring more of an aesthetic component here and a socio-educational 
function there [1]. 
Art involves “involves creative or imaginative talent expressive of technical 
proﬁciency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas” [2]. 
Science may be deﬁned as: 
A systematic endeavor that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable 
explanations and predictions about the universe [3].

Developments in Art and Science 
It is currently believed that scientiﬁc and engineering approaches to the natural world 
can be traced back to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia around 3000–1200 BCE [3] and 
is analyzable in many of the buildings (such pyramids, temples, monuments, tombs) 
which were constructed at this time and are still visible today. Also evident from this 
era are the vast number of cave paintings and art and decorative work in mosaics on 
the walls of such constructions. It clearly reached high levels of accomplishment in 
painting and sculpture which showed the style and symbolic representations of the 
period, many of which have lasted 4000 years and can be seen today (Figs. 10.1 and 
10.2) [4]. Mathematics, astronomy and medicine shaped Greek ideas when natural 
events in the world were analyzed in terms of cause and effect.

At the same time as these artworks and sculptures were being produced, the 
Egyptians were also constructing the pyramids (Fig. 10.3). In order to construct such 
a building, it was necessary to have a level and horizontal base, and also know the 
size and weight of the stone blocks and how they could be ﬁtted together, along with 
any alignment with external objects they required. Understanding the functions of 
surveying would have been necessary to some degree in order to produce plans for 
the construction, as well as the scheduling of the work. The margin of error was very 
low at 0.07%. In addition, the Great Pyramid was aligned with the cardinal points of 
the compass (north, south, east and west) to an accuracy of one ﬁfteenth of a degree.
98
R. Earnshaw
Therefore, some of the fundamental elements of precision in science and engineering 
were known and understood at this time. 
It is clear from these images that an understanding of the science and engineering 
aspects of construction were framed by design, form, and esthetics. It appears that 
art and science were working together in harmony, with each adding value to the 
other. They must have been magniﬁcent constructions in their day. The outer layers 
of the pyramids have been removed since then, which has resulted in their coarser

external appearance today, as in Fig. 10.3. The original casing stones are believed 
to be of white highly polished Tura limestone to reﬂect the sun’s rays. These would 
have given a smooth slope to the outside of the pyramids in contrast to the stepped 
appearance we see today. 
10.3 
Interrelationship of Art and Science 
It is clear that scientiﬁc and artistic views of the world have been intertwined 
throughout history, and perhaps more so than is generally accepted today. A gradual 
separation may be observed after the academy was established and early universities 
divided study into different disciplines where students had to specialize. It was not 
long before a degree of antipathy developed between the earlier disciplines such 
as logic, grammar and rhetoric, and those that came later on such science and engi-
neering. These were deemed to be applied knowledge and of lesser value and priority 
than fundamental knowledge. However, the events of the Scientiﬁc Revolution in the 
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries revolutionized the understanding of the natural 
world by means of observation and experiment. It replaced the Greek view of nature 
that had held sway for 2000 years [5]. 
It was the advances in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and chem-
istry which transformed the views of society about the world. This led inevitably 
to the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when this 
understanding of nature was able to be harnessed by means of the developments 
in steam power, water power, mechanization, manufacturing, the smelting of iron 
ore, and architectural innovations to house the new businesses. Transportation was 
transformed by these new sources of energy and power [6]. 
It is often thought that science progresses by observation, analysis, and reason, 
whereas art advances through imagination, expression, and emotion. However, both 
involve aspects of communication, whether to validate the results of science, or 
to display the artistic work. In addition, artistic expression and scientiﬁc discovery 
have a common basis in creativity, perseverance, and insight. Many leading scientists 
have also been practitioners in the arts such as Einstein, Pasteur, Morse, Heisenberg, 
Planck, and Sidhof [7–9]. 
Science may be subdivided into the formal sciences (such as logic and mathe-
matics), natural sciences (such as physical science, earth science, and life science), 
and social sciences (such as the social and cultural aspects of human behavior). 
Applied sciences include engineering and medicine [10]. 
Art may be subdivided into the visual arts, literature, architecture, cinema, music, 
theater and dance. Interactive media may also be included in a wider deﬁnition of 
art [11, 12]. 
Both science and art are involved in creation. Science may produce a model or 
description of the natural world and then make deductions from it. Art may depict a 
world view, or imagine an object not yet created. Therefore, the work of scientists 
and artists involves creativity.
100
R. Earnshaw
Einstein said: 
After a certain high level of technical skill is achieved, science and art tend to coalesce in 
aesthetics, plasticity, and form. The greatest scientists are always artists as well [13]. 
The reason why art is necessary to science because creativity involves imagination, and 
imagination is visualization. Things we are able to conceptualize, visualize or imagine in 
our mind are the things we can also create, if we have the tools to do so. Oftentimes, some 
of the greatest discoveries in science involved using some form of art [14]. 
10.4 
The Contribution of Art to the Computer 
Artists and designers have contributed to the development of computers. Particularly 
notable are Apple products with their sleek design, esthetics, usability, and use of 
color. Apple’s Mission Statement encapsulates the high priority they attach to these 
kind of attributes: 
Bringing the best user experience to its customers through innovative hardware, software 
and services [15]. 
Apple’s vision statement is: 
We believe that we are on the face of the earth to make great products and that’s not changing 
[15]. 
Artists have also used the computer to produce computer art (alternatively known 
as digital art). This can be any kind of image, multimedia, performance art, or gallery 
installation. The lines between traditional art and new media art have become blurred, 
as some artworks combine both of these components [16–18]. 
Computers can be used to produce realistic images for animations and ﬁlms (e.g., 
Fig. 10.4). Artists often contribute to the design and manipulation of the graphics 
algorithms that produce such images—in order to obtain the overall style and form 
required.
Visualization Data Artists 
Computers are increasingly being used to analyze very large data sets, often involving 
scientiﬁc information, or the results of simulations. In these situations, the only 
useful way to interpret the data is to use visualization tools to present images or 
animations on a display. Given that colors and scale often shape the way such images 
are interpreted, artists are often involved so that the images are presented in an 
optimum way. Artists can make the signiﬁcance of the data visible [19–21]. 
Computer Art 
Artists may also use such data and visualizations to produce artworks in their own 
right [22]. Such data has become an art form in its own right [23].

Contribution of Art and Design to Research 
and Development Projects 
As summarized in the Chapter on ‘Research and Development on Creativity’ in this 
volume: 
Partnerships which have to deliver a product or service normally have partners with expertise 
in usability testing, user trials, human computer interaction, and art and design. In order for 
a product or service to be viable in the market-place it has to justify its existence and provide 
function, form, and value to the appropriate sector, as well as being able to appeal to potential 
users. This is where expertise in art and design can add value to the product. Such partners 
can add value in all areas of the EU’s projects, not just in culture and creativity. This is 
where a consortium with interdisciplinary expertise is able to make signiﬁcant contributions 
in Europe and also internationally. 
10.6 
Conclusions 
The contributions of the arts to the sciences have now come almost full circle. From 
the remarkable artworks and sculptures over 4000 years ago, to the sophisticated 
images and visualizations produced on the current supercomputers, the power, imag-
ination, and creativity of the artist is clear to see. New tools have been created for 
the artist to use and the scientist has beneﬁted from the artist’s creative input to assist 
in analyzing data in the form of images. Artists and scientists can work together in 
harmony once again.

Research and Development in Creativity
Rae Earnshaw
Abstract The art and science of creativity and the creative process are examined.
Analytic capabilities using information technology are supporting this work. Digital
creativity is a focus for bringing together different disciplines, and also for providing
support to the creative industries sector. The relationship between creativity and
innovation is examined. National and international initiatives for research and devel-
opment in creativity are presented. Many of these initiatives have funding programs
which are seeking to investigate cognitive models of creativity using information
technology, and also how creativity can be used to more effectively advance the
research and development process. In addition, new tools are being developed to
support creativity.

Introduction
Many disciplines are seeking a greater understanding of creativity in order to be
able to further research and development in their areas. Many national governments
are investing in programs to improve the productivity of their work forces in order
to overcome current problems and difﬁculties. Often this is perceived to be ﬁnding
creative solutions to these problems leading to greater efﬁciency and effectiveness,
and greater economic stability.
Four aspects to research and development in creativity are highlighted in this
chapter. These may be summarized as follows:
1. The scientiﬁc and artistic analysis of creativity
2. Application of creativity to assist in research and development
3. Using creative approaches to advance interdisciplinary research and development
4. Creativity and innovation.

Scientiﬁc and Artistic Analysis of Creativity
This may be considered as research into creativity. How may it be deﬁned? What kind
of cognitive models lead to a greater understanding of its operation and applicability?
Can context and environmental factors aid in its development and effectiveness?
In such modeling, simulation, and analysis, information technology is often used
to gather data and perform computations and visualizations. This aspect may be
described as the scientiﬁc and artistic analysis of creativity.
Application of Creativity to Assist in Research and Development
The second aspect is to more fully understand how creativity may be used in
research to advance knowledge and understanding in academic disciplines. What
approaches can make creativity more effective at uncovering unknown information
and knowledge?
Interdisciplinary Research and Development
This considers the question of how creative approaches may be used to advance
interdisciplinary research and development (R&D). Many academic disciplines exist
insilosduetothebudgetallocationmechanismswithintheacademyandthetraditions
within disciplines. How can these barriers be overcome by using creative strategies?
New knowledge often arises at the boundaries between existing disciplines and it is
therefore important to be able to beneﬁt from this.
Creativity and Innovation
Creativity may be regarded as producing new and novel ideas, and innovation as
seeking out ways to implement them. However, the boundary can become fuzzy
when all partners are working together on a project.
Each of these aspects will now be considered in more detail.
11.2
Research into Creativity
Psychologist Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi studied more than 90 men and women who
possessed the following characteristics:
(1) they produced works that were publicly recognized as creative, and
(2) they inﬂuenced or affected their culture in some important way.
This led to the psychological concept of ‘ﬂow’ [1], a highly focused mental state
conducive to productivity [2–4]. It may be characterized by complete absorption in
a particular task, and ability to focus intensely on seeking to understand the task.
Dietrich identiﬁed four types of creativity with corresponding brain activities as
follows [5, 6]:
• Deliberate and cognitive creativity
• Deliberate and emotional creativity
11
Research and Development in Creativity
105
• Spontaneous and cognitive creativity
• Spontaneous and emotional creativity.
Dietrich also summarized these as a deliberate mode, a spontaneous mode, and a
ﬂow mode [7].
Other researchers have also proposed various stages of creativity as follows [8]:
• Intention. Your idea is born
• Incubation. This is the time you begin to put thoughts together
• Investigation. Here is where you do research
• Composition. This is the DO part where you begin to compose
• Compose—Get it out
• Clariﬁcation
• Changes
• Completion.
Hennessey [9, 10] describes the Consensual Assessment Technique which enables
a panel of experts to assess the degree of creativity inherent in a particular product.
Although creativity may be difﬁcult to deﬁne and characterize, many people are able
identify it and recognize it when they see it.
Creativity and Intelligence
Research in creativity views creativity and intelligence as different attributes which
most studies appear to show can only be weakly correlated at best, though other
studies seek to show a relationship between creativity test scores and IQ scores
[11–14].
11.3
The Application of Creativity to Assist in Research
and Development
Epstein recommends [15]:
• Capture your new ideas. Keep an idea notebook or voice recorder with you, type
in new thoughts on your laptop or write ideas down on a napkin.
• Seek out challenging tasks. Take on projects that don’t necessarily have a solu-
tion—such as trying to ﬁgure out how to make your dog ﬂy or how to build a
perfect model of the brain. This causes old ideas to compete, which helps generate
new ones.
• Broaden your knowledge. Take a class outside psychology or read journals in
unrelated ﬁelds, suggests Epstein. This makes more diverse knowledge available
for interconnection, he says, which is the basis for all creative thought. “Ask for
permission to sit in on lectures for a class on twelfth century architecture and take
notes,” he suggests. “You’ll do better in psychology and life if you broaden your
knowledge.”
106
R. Earnshaw
• Surround yourself with interesting things and people. Regular dinners with
diverse and interesting friends and a work space festooned with out-of-the-
ordinary objects will help you develop more original ideas, Epstein says. You
can also keep your thoughts lively by taking a trip to an art museum or attending
an opera—anything that stimulates new thinking.
The American Psychological Association states [16]:
A study last year in the Creativity Research Journal (Vol. 20, No. 1), found that working
on these four areas enhances creativity. Seventy-four city employees from Orange County,
Calif., participated in creativity training seminars consisting of games and exercises devel-
oped by Epstein to strengthen their proﬁciency in these four skill sets. Eight months later, the
employees had increased their rate of new idea generation by 55 percent—a feat that led to
more than $600,000 in new revenue and a savings of about $3.5 million through innovative
cost reductions.
A number of funded research programs are seeking to identify how creativity can
assist in various research areas.
Kelly provides guidance on developing creativity for research and those mentoring
research [17]. This is based on a curriculum developed at the Hasso Plattner Institute
of Design at Stanford University.
By focusing attention on how research happens as well as its outputs, you can increase your
ability to address research challenges and produce the outputs you care about. Simultane-
ously, you may also transform your emotional relationship with your work, replacing stress
and a harsh inner critic with a more open and emotionally empowered attitude. Whatever
your background, discipline, or career stage, this book can give you concrete tools to gain
clarity, be innovative, and make progress in your research journey [17]
In our work at the Stanford d.school, we’ve found that creative processes are useful
to practitioners across many disciplines—design, business, and education to name a few.
Through compelling, straightforward prose and concrete examples, this book shows that
creative thinking is equally useful for researchers of all kinds. It is exciting to imagine the
possibilities that will surely come from the approaches presented inside [17].
11.4
Using Creative Approaches to Advance
Interdisciplinary Research and Development
A particularly signiﬁcant gulf may exist between the sciences on the one hand and the
arts and humanities on the other. When funding in the academy becomes constrained
orlimited,questionsbegintobeaskedabouthoweffectivevariousdisciplinesare,and
their overall beneﬁt to society. This can set faculties in the academy in opposition
to each other at the very time when more effective solutions may be found by a
greater interworking. Snow characterized this as the two cultures [18]. This has been
analyzed further in [19].
This appeared to be due to a variety of factors including tradition, vocabulary, ways of
working, and contributions to society, all of which could be different in different disciplines
and circumstances. Critchley [20] proposed that Snow had diagnosed the emergence of
11
Research and Development in Creativity
107
two cultures because of the loss of a common framework of understanding. Scientists and
engineers favoured advancement of society through technology and industry, whereas the arts
andhumanitiespreferredintellectualandliteraryendeavor.However,Gouldtookanopposing
point of view and emphasized the commonalities between science and the humanities [21]. In
1963, Snow appeared to take a more optimistic view about the relationship between science
and the arts [19, 22]
In the Foreword to [19] Journeaux states:
In an interview with Alfred Appel Jr., in 1966, Vladimir Nabokov reacted to C.P. Snow’s
assertion that the gap between the two supposedly separate cultures of science and the
arts was unbridgeable. He argued that science has an artistic and creative side and that the
arts require scientiﬁc truths, saying: “I certainly welcome the free exchange of terminology
between any branch of science and any raceme of art. There is no science without fancy, and
no art without facts” [23].
Journeaux also wrote:
However, if we consider the processes and ambitions associated with creativity supposed
differences between artists and scientists may become less distinct. Creativity theorist Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi reminds us that: “creativity does not happen inside people’s heads, but in
the interaction between a person’s thoughts and a sociocultural context. It is systemic rather
than an individual phenomena” [2]. In his book Creativity Csikszentmihalyi argues that
levels of creativity do not just depend upon creative individuals but are also affected by the
willingness of domains and ﬁelds to recognise novel ideas and artefacts [2].
11.5
Creativity and Innovation
Creativity and innovation may be related but the former is primarily concerned
with the generation of ideas (which may also be innovative) and the latter is more
concerned with the applicability of the ideas and their expression in practical situa-
tions. This may involve changing the existing processes within a particular organi-
zation or system. For example, as products and services evolve through innovation,
companies have to decide the optimum time to migrate to a new system or a new set
of products while maintaining existing market share, and also being able to attract
new customers as demands shift in the market-place [24].
11.6
Research Funding Which Includes Creativity
This section summarizes funding programs related to creativity in research and
development in the European Union, Fraunhofer in Germany, the National Science
Foundation in the USA, and the UK.

Horizon Europe—Cluster 2: “Culture, Creativity and Inclusive Society”
Under Horizon Europe, the European Commission funds research and innovation
projects for social, economic, technological and cultural transformations toward
healthier democracies where cultural values are protected.
HorizonEuropeisadoptingacreativitythemeinitsfundingofCluster2.TheEuro-
pean Commission mobilized e158 million for four calls under Horizon Europe—
Cluster2:Culture,CreativityandInclusiveSociety.TheCluster2callsopenedinJune
2021 and closed on the 7th of October. The European Research Executive Agency
(REA) received 378 applications across the four calls. 51 projects were selected for
funding in June 2022.
Partnerships which have to deliver a product or service normally have partners
with expertise in usability testing, user trials, human computer interaction, and art
and design. In order for a product or service to be viable in the market-place it has to
justify its existence and provide function, form, and value to the appropriate sector,
as well as being able to appeal to potential users. This is where expertise in art and
design can add value to the product. Such partners can add value in all areas of the
EU’s projects, not just in culture and creativity. This is where a consortium with
interdisciplinary expertise is able to make signiﬁcant contributions in Europe and
also internationally.
The EU wishes to ensure that the program of work enables the research and
innovation to be transformative across businesses and society as a whole within the
European Research Area (ERA).
In order to address today’s multiple challenges, ERA needs to accelerate the transitions,
strengthen resilience to future crises, while sustaining its competitiveness. High quality
results require sufﬁcient levels of investments in R&I, in particular from Member States
and the private sector. Lagging innovation ecosystems can hardly improve without intense
cooperation between academia and industry accompanied by better access to excellent facil-
ities and infrastructures. While overall the EU is already leading in research and scientiﬁc
excellence, it needs to step up its support to breakthrough market-driven innovations that
will underpin green digital Europe and will boost growth, job creation and competitiveness.
Only an excellent and impactful R&I system, will offer attractive career paths for researchers,
mutually favourable circulation of talents within the EU and increase attractiveness of the
EU abroad [27, 28].
The next section details how EU funding of projects operates.
European Union (EU) Funding of Projects and Initiatives
The European funds various kinds of initiatives and projects, usually by evaluating
proposals that respond to Calls at particular times that deﬁne the priorities of the
Call, the areas it covers, and the funding available.
Research and development projects are intended to be collaborative and have been
funded in the past through various Frameworks. Horizon 2020 and ran from 2014 to
2020 with a budget of approx. $80 billion [29].
Horizon Europe is the current EU research and innovation program. It has a budget
of e95.5 billion and runs until 2027. More than 85% of the budget is to be allocated
to collaborative projects.
11
Research and Development in Creativity
109
The programme facilitates collaboration and strengthens the impact of research and inno-
vation in developing, supporting and implementing EU policies while tackling global chal-
lenges. It supports creating and better dispersing of excellent knowledge and technologies. It
creates jobs, fully engages the EU’s talent pool, boosts economic growth, promotes industrial
competitiveness and optimises investment impact within a strengthened European Research
Area. Legal entities from the EU and associated countries can participate [30]
Project proposals normally consist of 3 or more partners from different EU
member states [31]. It is expected that the partners have the necessary expertise
in order to carry out the R&D detailed in the proposal. In practice, most consortia are
typically 10–20 partners, but some can have 30 or more. Duration of the project can
be 3–5 years. The contribution that each partner makes to the delivery of the project
is deﬁned in the project proposal and partners usually have complementary exper-
tise. For example, the research organization (e.g., universities or research institutes)
can provide the state of the art knowledge at the cutting edge of research, indus-
trial companies can provide development and manufacturing of prototypes and sales
and marketing, and telecommunication providers can provide expertise on network
delivery. SMEs, and-users, and marketing agencies can provide speciﬁc expertise
that is required by the project. Associate partners and sub-contractors with speciﬁc
functions can also be involved in the project but are not signatories of the EU grant
agreement. Participants from non-EU countries can also be partners in the consor-
tium. If the project proposal is approved, their funding component is paid for by their
particular country and not the EU. Following the UK’s departure from the Euro-
pean Union, organizations based in the UK can no longer be partners in proposals.
However, the UK is intending to be an associate to Horizon Europe. If this is not
approved, then an associate partnership in a proposal may be possible.
The objective is for the project to deliver a program of work for the development
of new assets, and new products and services that meet the needs of European and
international markets. Each partner in the consortium is expected to add value and
expertise to the project as a whole, so that the overall project is able to deliver more
than the sum of its parts. Proposals normally also a deﬁne a Consortium Agreement
which deﬁnes how any intellectual, or other assets, which are developed during the
project are to be shared across the partnership during and after the conclusion of
the project. Such Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) can include patents, trademarks,
copyrights, and any prototypes that may be developed in the project. The project is led
by a Project Co-ordinator who is normally someone with appropriate management
and commercial experience.
Normally a proposal as expected to have an appropriate balance between academic
institutions, private sector research and innovation, and end-user organizations.
The EU regards businesses as the ‘engine of innovation’. Therefore, being able
to involve them in wider partnerships with complementary expertise should be able
to signiﬁcantly drive this process forward with greater efﬁciency and effectiveness
[32].
Project proposals are reviewed by a panel of experts in the subject area(s) of the
proposal call and then ranked. Generally, many more proposals are received than
can be funded. For example, for the Horizon Europe Cluster: Culture, Creativity
110
R. Earnshaw
and Inclusive Society, the European Research Executive Agency 378 applications
in 2021 across 4 calls, and 51 projects were funded starting in 2022. This gives a
success rate of about 1 in 7 [33].
In FP7, partners included:
• research groups at universities or research institutes;
• companies intending to innovate;
• SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) or their groupings;
• public administration;
• researchers (from early-stage to experienced);
• research infrastructures;
• civil society organizations;
• organizationsandresearchersfromthirdcountriesandinternationalorganizations.
It can be difﬁcult for those new to the process to ﬁnd appropriate partners that will
be able to work together effectively on a proposal, and then on the project itself, if
the proposal is successful. Joining a network can help in understanding the expertise
sets available in European organizations and industry. Networks of Excellence were
initiated during the EU’s FP6 program. They can also provide contacts of potential
partners in other EU states. Generally, they have a large number of partners with
cognate interests who met from time to time to share ideas, and promote seminars
and conferences. It also enabled those who wished to produce a program of work to
join together and develop a project proposal.
National governments are concerned that their investment in the academies can
be seen by their populations to deliver societal and economic beneﬁts. Therefore,
universities are increasingly including relationships with industry and business in
their mission statements, alongside teaching and research. For example, the UK
has the Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF) to support knowledge transfer to
industry. Its objective is to beneﬁt the economy and society [34].
This updated agenda for many of the academies in Europe enables them to
synchronize more closely with the requirements of the EU research and development
programs.
Fraunhofer
The Fraunhofer organization in Germany supports 76 institutes in Germany which
focus on different aspects of applied science. Many have close relationships with
academic institutions in their geographical areas [35, 36].
European Research Council
The EU also provides funding for frontier research in any ﬁeld through the European
Research Council (ERC). The average success rate for applications is around 12%.
The sole criterion for acceptance is excellence. There are no thematic priorities or
geographical quotas.

In the ERC Work Programme, the ERC Scientiﬁc Council earmarked e628 million for an
estimated 407 Starting Grants in 2023. The ERC is now beginning the evaluation of the
proposals. The projects selected for funding are planned to be announced in summer 2023
[37, 38].
EU work programs are monitored to evaluate their impact and effectiveness [39].
National Science Foundation
The objective of the CISE is to explore the synergies between creativity and
information technology, science, engineering, and design research.
Information technology is playing an increasing role in extending the capability of human
creative thinking and problem solving. Design, as a reﬂective process, develops new prod-
ucts in the context of a perceived need or problem. In design, the reﬂection on problem
ﬁnding becomes as important as problem solving, recognizing that designers often redeﬁne
the problem to be solved as they explore design solutions within a speciﬁc context. The
combination of creativity and design thinking in information technology, science, and engi-
neering has the potential to deﬁne new areas and lead to increased successful innovation.
Considering the synergy of creativity with research in design can have outcomes such as
new models of creative cognitive and computational processes [40].
One of the research areas seeks to understand creative cognition and computation:
This area has two major thrusts: research and education. Research in this area leads to
cognitive models that serve as inspiration for computational models of creativity, support
for human creativity, and approaches for educating people to be more creative. This research
is typically done by adopting or adapting a model of cognition and evaluating its creative
performance in different contexts, or developing a new model of creativity based on empirical
or ethnographic studies. The emphasis in this area is the development of new models of
cognitionandcomputationthatexplainorsimulatecreativity.Thesemodelsmaythenbecome
the basis for new tools and new educational environments [40].
Another area is to develop information technology to support creativity:
This area both develops new software and user interfaces to support users in being more
creative and evaluates their performance through user studies either in controlled environ-
ments with empirical studies or in the context of a complex problem or situation with ethno-
graphic studies. The emphasis in this area is the development of new support tools where
the tool itself may be a creative product, and the tool is intended to support people in their
creative activities [40].
UK Arts and Humanities Research Program
The Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) launched the Creative Indus-
tries Clusters Programme in 2018. The £120 million investment continues to drive
innovation and growth across the UK’s creative industries, to encourage a new type
of applied research. It lasts from 2018 to 2023 [41, 42].
The AHRC also supplies funding to enhance the international impact of research
related to the creative economy and global sustainable development [43, 44].
A complementary review of art and design examines how research and develop-
ment in these areas can be formulated and framed and then evaluated and measured,
particularly in terms of the quality of their research outputs [45].

Conclusions
Creativity is a hot topic with many researchers and national governments. The latter
are concerned to devise methods and strategies to support businesses and national
economies, and make them more internationally-leading and more resilient to prob-
lems and crises. Researchers are seeking to understand what makes creativity effec-
tive and how it can be optimized and harnessed to a greater degree. Funding programs
in the areas summarized in this chapter are all seeking to obtain answers to these
important questions.

Epilog 
Rae Earnshaw 
Abstract Various aspects of creativity are summarized. Some have known 
constraints and others have unknown constraints. The ways in which technology 
have been utilized in the creative process are summarized. Technology that offers 
the facility of interaction with the user enables iterative production of designs and 
creative works. The relationship between creativity, art, design, and technology is 
summarized in a set of propositions. 
Keywords iPad paintbrush · Unconstrained creativity · Constrained creativity ·
Virtual environments · Connectivity · Internalizing images 
12.1 Freedom to Create 
Today’s mixed interdisciplinary environments offer artists and designers signiﬁcant 
opportunities to create new art forms and designs. They can also provide new ways 
of collaboration and connectivity which can be valuable for various kinds of creative 
works. In addition, multidisciplinary teams are able to share concepts and ideas over 
the network and work in the same design space via technology. 
Each of the previous chapters contains a conclusions section which summarizes 
the main points in the chapter. It is not the purpose of this ﬁnal chapter to repeat 
these conclusions, but rather to view the subject from a higher perspective. It seeks 
to understand why Leonardo da Vinci’s creative ideas and drawings with regard to 
ﬂight referred to in Chap. 1 took over 400 years to be realized in practice. This 
provides a relevant case study in seeking to understand the various elements of the 
relationship between creativity, art, design and technology. 
12.2 Creativity Under Known Constraints 
Painters may choose different brushes, or modify an existing brush, in order to achieve 
a particular effect in the artwork. Hockney was able to modify an iPad ‘paint brush’ 
with academic assistance in order to obtain the visual effect that he desired [1–3].

The iPad also enabled the natural environment to be ‘painted’ more quickly so that 
various images could be produced for different times of the day. 
There is a fear that any artwork which utilizes technology, especially in a digital manner, 
creates a distance between the artist and their media, says Creed, ‘but there is an acces-
sibility to these prints because you can imagine how they were created. With Hockney’s 
paintings so much of the process is hidden, but with the iPad there’s much more evidence of 
mark making.’ Almost paradoxically, Hockney’s use of technology reveals the more tenuous 
human imperfections not found in his older acrylic works. It gives a window into how he 
moved his brush — or hand — across the tablet, through which we can clearly see the 
performative, gestural approach taken while creating these prints [4]. 
Proposition 1—Creativity and Computer Images 
Where appropriate technology is utilized by an artist, the outcomes can be signiﬁcant 
in their impact and value, as is evidenced by the iPad images produced by Hockney. 
This may be especially the case when these images are seen at a large scale in an 
exhibition. It is much more than a set of photographs and does allow the observer to 
internalize the experience of viewing the images. 
Proposition 2—Creativity and Technology Dependencies 
Some creative initiatives and outputs are reliant upon developments in the external 
environment. For example, it is unlikely that Hockney’s iPad paintings would have 
been produced in their form and content without the prior development of the iPad. 
Proposition 3—Creativity and Unexpected Outcomes 
Developments in technology may not anticipate how they may be utilized in creative 
applications. Nevertheless, they can have unexpected advantages and beneﬁts that 
may go far beyond the initial intentions of the technology. 
12.3 Creativity Under Unknown Constraints 
Three design scenarios are considered in this section. Their relationship to Leonardo 
da Vinci’s drawings in the ﬁfteenth century is explored. These drawings all had 
interesting and novel features but lacked a source of power or energy to enable them 
to function in the real world. Therefore, the constraints for their operation in the 
real world were not known or understood. Three sources of power are considered as 
follows:
• Steam engine
• Internal combustion engine
• Jet engine. 
The ﬁrst point to note is that prior to the Scientiﬁc Revolution (sixteenth to seven-
teenth centuries) it was not known how humans might be able to generate a ﬂying 
machine. They had observed the ﬂight of birds and deduced that heavier than air ﬂight
12
Epilog
117
should be possible [5]. By a recognition of natural laws and utilizing the processes 
of observation, analysis and experiment, it was possible to make more systematic 
progress in understanding nature and how its properties might be harnessed for the 
beneﬁt of society. 
Leonardo da Vinci in the 1480s had over 200 drawings and sketches that showed 
how he understood ﬂight [6]. However, these did tend to concentrate on the ﬂapping 
of wings, no doubt to mimic how birds appeared to ﬂy. This illustrated the power of 
observation coupled with imagination and creativity. However, subsequently it was 
shown that these did not work in practice because they did not satisfy a number of 
design constraints which were not known until much later. These constraints were 
linked to a scientiﬁc understanding of the natural world. 
Proposition 4—Creativity Under Unknown Constraints 
In order for creativity to result in successful outcomes in particular practical situa-
tions, there is a need for an understanding of how it may be limited by the constraints 
inherent in those situations. 
Prior to the Industrial Revolution (eighteenth to nineteenth centuries) it was not 
known how technology might change traditional practices because it had not yet been 
invented. The development of the steam engine during this period enabled signiﬁcant 
amounts of power to be generated using natural resources (water and coal). However, 
containment and transmission of this power needed strong and heavy materials. They 
were used very successfully in engines for trains, cotton mills, and pumping stations. 
But they were far too heavy to be used in a ﬂying machine. 
However, the invention of the internal combustion engine in the nineteenth century 
using liquid fuel enabled the power to weight ratio to be signiﬁcantly improved. Such 
engines were used in a variety of applications [5]. 
Between 1899 and 1905 the Wright brothers devised research and experiments 
that led to the ﬁrst powered airplane in 1903 and a ﬂying machine in 1905 [7]. 
The key design constraints that had to be understood were the design of the wings 
and also the speed of a ﬁxed wing through the air that was needed to generate an 
appropriate amount of lift. Thus, although creativity had produced many ideas and 
designs prior to this, they did not work in practice until they also aligned with the 
physical laws to do with ﬂight, and also the capabilities of industry to produce a 
design according to a speciﬁcation. 
Proposition 5—Creativity and Appropriate Use of Technology 
There is an important relationship between creativity, design and technology. In 
order for the results of creativity to be harnessed in an optimum way, they need to 
synchronize with the requirements and limits of technology, and also the interfaces 
and designs necessary to utilize the technology successfully. 
A further example is the design and development of the jet engine for airplanes 
by Whittle [8, 9] and others. It was capable of producing much more power than 
the internal combustion engine. However, because it was sufﬁciently different from 
the traditional internal combustion engine airplane with a propellor, the authorities 
in the UK were not sufﬁciently convinced to invest in it. This is an example of
118
R. Earnshaw
where creativity allied with a correct understanding of science and technology was 
too advanced for the authorities to fully understand. Had it been recognized, the 
outcome of events at the time could have been completely different. 
In a conversation with Whittle after the war, von Ohain stated: 
If you had been given the money you would have been six years ahead of us. If Hitler or 
Goering had heard that there is a man in England who ﬂies 500 mph in a small experimental 
plane and that it is coming into development, it is likely that World War II would not have 
come into being [10]. 
Proposition 6—Creativity and Overcoming Difﬁculties 
Some creative outputs are unable to reach their full potential if there is opposition 
within the society in which they are being created. In such cases, it could take months 
or years for such blockages to be overcome. 
12.4 Creativity and Virtual Environments 
Virtual environments can provide a 3D environment within which artists and 
designers can explore the use of different colors and materials [11]. Architects can 
try out different designs for buildings and explore how they ﬁt into the surrounding 
environment, and also how they are perceived by people who walk within them. 
This can be very useful information to consider before they are built. Additional 
constraints such as the use of sustainable building materials, carbon footprint, and 
ecological factors can be incorporated into the project at the design stage. 
It can be argued that a virtual environment is artiﬁcial and not a real-world envi-
ronment. It is therefore only a representation of the real world. However, the output 
of an artist or a designer’s building plans are also representations of the real-world. 
As such, it is simply a tool for artists and designers to use in any way they wish. It has 
been claimed that the use of technology can make it more difﬁcult for the creator to 
establish an emotional connection with their creation. However, while this might be 
the case in a ﬁrst application, successive uses will allow the creator to appreciate the 
opportunities and potential of the tool being used, just as the early painters adapted 
to the use of the paintbrush. 
Such facilities can also support the use of audio and animations. These can add 
value to the visual image. 
Proposition 7—Creativity and Virtual Environments 
Virtual environments can offer new creative opportunities for artists and designers 
and enable them to immerse themselves more completely in various forms of 
representation and interact with them.

12.5 Conclusion 
Science and technology may often be perceived as the primary drivers in a material 
world, resulting in the arts and humanities being forced into a more reactive position. 
However, when questions are asked about the values of the science, or the meaning 
that technological developments have uncovered, these disciplines are often at a 
loss. It may be regarded as ‘beyond science’. This is where art can make a valuable 
contribution in being able to connect us with worlds outside science. At the same 
time, art practice has been forced by these developments to think of knowledge 
acquisition outside that of art alone. Therefore, all parties can be beneﬁciaries of 
collaboration and mutual understanding.
