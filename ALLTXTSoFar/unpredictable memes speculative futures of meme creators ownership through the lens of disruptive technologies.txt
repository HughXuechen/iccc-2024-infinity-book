ABSTRACT 
Unpredictable Memes explores the impact of technological change on the 
creation and propagation of memes in contemporary digital culture and 
envisions a possible future for the meme creator’s ownership. In this thesis, I 
begin with a historical and economic review to delve into technological 
movements and trends on social media in the attention economy, 
highlighting how Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms and Blockchain 
technologies disrupt the monetization of memes in ways that affect the 
ownership. Considering the legal and ethical segments of the potential future 
of meme monetization, the review of copyright and ownership of human and 
AI-created memes. I employ Economic Constructivism and Participatory 
Speculation as methodologies to collaboratively imagine both optimistic and 
dark future scenarios with experts from different fields related to memes, to 
create an interactive documentary that depicts the evolution of meme 
creators and the proposed vision of their future. Through this study, I 
speculate that in the future, AI algorithms will present new opportunities to 
catalyze human creativity for meme creators and to think of what creators 
should do to avoid homogenization of creativity, while Blockchain 
technologies will open up possibilities for emerging communities where 
meme creators can reshape ownership and scarcity in valuing creativity.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 
ABOUT THE PROJECT 
Meme culture refers to the cultural phenomenon that has emerged through 
the creation and propagation of internet memes. Memes are usually found in 
the form of humorous images, videos, or pieces of text that spread rapidly 
through social media and other digital platforms, often evolving and 
changing as they are shared and remixed by different users. The 
deconstruction or subversion of authority by internet memes allows everyone 
to participate in the creation and dissemination of content, liberating 
individuals from the limitations imposed from being an audience and 
enabling them to become their own creators and propagators. 
Creating and sharing memes also brings people together through humor, 
irony and wit, fostering a sense of belonging and endorse self-expression in 
virtual communities. Saint Hoax, a prominent meme creator with three 
million Instagram followers argues that, “The power of a meme lies in its 
transmissibility and unique knack for being cross-cultural” ( as cited in 
Benveniste, 2022). Memes can serve a variety of functions, from social 
commentary to cultural critique and political satire, and they have become a 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
significant part of contemporary digital culture. At the same time, they raise a 
bundle of issues related to authorship, copyright and ownership. 
The nature of memes as a democratic source of collective creativity means 
that ownership is often diffuse and shared among many people. While some 
memes are created by individuals for commercial or branding purposes, 
many memes are created and shared freely and without any expectation of 
compensation. Additionally, because memes often rely on existing cultural 
references and images, it is difficult to determine who holds the copyright or 
intellectual property rights since there are various elements that make up a 
meme. With the advent of Blockchain technologies and AI algorithms, the 
creators’ ownership of memes has become a topic of increasing interest, 
particularly in light of technological advancements that have disrupted 
traditional models of content creation and distribution. The research is 
presented in the form of an interactive documentary that invites the 
audience to explore the journey collaboratively. 
This research project constructs a resemblance of meme creation. It will 
repackage the “two main mechanisms of meme creation - mimicry and 
remix” (Shifman, 2015, p. 20). Mimicry associates the practice of 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“reconstruction”- through the exploration of the literature review, I intend to 
explore the potential for AI algorithms, AI meme generators and Non-
Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to disrupt conventional models of meme 
monetization, reflecting on how the technological evolution intertwines with 
the economic model change in the evolution of memes, and implementing 
internet memes to become a cultural and economic force, with the potential 
to generate revenue and influence consumer behavior. Remixing involves 
group speculation through the Participatory Workshop, taking the collective 
imagination of the group and transforming it into an interactive 
documentary by blending different ideas, perspectives, and styles into one 
digital artifact. 
By engaging in speculation regarding the potential futures of meme creators’ 
ownership within the context of technology and economics, this research 
provides a novel approach to discussing meme culture through a techno-
economic lens. This approach necessitates an understanding of memes in 
relation to disruptive technologies, including Artificial Intelligence and NFT 
memes. Furthermore, this research assesses the impact of these technologies 
on the meme economy and the commodification of digital artifacts. By 
exploring the possibilities that disruptive innovations present for meme 
creators and digital content creators, this research considers new 
10 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
opportunities for generating revenue and potential challenges that may arise 
in terms of preserving the diversity and freedom of meme creation. 
PROJECT MOTIVATION 
The emergence and development of each and every internet meme engages 
extensive participation from netizens (the users of the Internet), thus 
rendering individualism in internet culture appears devoid of footing in the 
process of meme propagation. Memes reflect a form of connectivity among 
groups, as netizens collaboratively push forward the dissemination of certain 
cultural elements. The viral spread resulting from such efforts cultivates a 
collective atmosphere, providing each participant involved in meme creation 
and dissemination with a sense of communal identity. 
The rise of meme culture has revolutionized the way people interact and 
express themselves in the digital world. Memes are a powerful tool that 
enables anyone to participate in the creation and dissemination of content, 
breaking down traditional barriers to entry and moving to a new era of 
cultural expression. Due to the popularity of memes and the prevalence of 
social media, visual symbols such as images and videos have gradually taken 
over as the main medium of communication, displacing text. These features 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
of meme have provided a new avenue for advertisers and digital marketers to 
reach audiences and create engaging experiences, and open up commercial 
prospects for meme creators to monetize their work. 
The motivation behind this thesis stems from the increasing prevalence of 
disruptive technologies, such as Blockchain and AI algorithms, and their 
potential impact on the monetization of memes. As both digital and cultural 
artifacts are created and shared online, memes are an excellent example of 
free expression and human creativity in the digital age. However, memes 
pose various challenges to the development of copyright law, and many of 
these issues remain unresolved. This demonstrates the fascinating and 
challenging nature of researching copyright law, and I aim to investigate how 
Blockchain technologies can provide solutions to these issues. 
Additionally, the advent of these technologies and their intertwinement with 
economic models of memes raises questions about how this disruption may 
affect the possibilities for creators to monetize their work and maintain 
control over its copyright and ownership. This thesis will explore these 
potential impacts and consider the future problems related to human 
creativity in the context of disruptive technologies and the changes in value 
influenced by technological disruption. I seek to explore potential threats and 
value conflicts that may arise regarding the ownership of memes. Memes are 
known as a democratic source of collective creativity. However, when meme 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
creators begin to claim ownership over their creations, conflicts may arise. 
These conflicts could involve issues such as copyright infringement or 
disputes over creative control. 
RESEARCH QUESTIONS 
The project seeks to explore the following questions: 
Primary Research Questions 
How might technological changes on social media platforms impact a 
creator’s ownership of memes? 
Secondary Research Questions 
How might disruptive technologies including Blockchain and AI algorithms 
impact the monetization of memes in ways that affect creators? 
How can Participatory Speculation and interactive documentaries with 
experts be used to imagine the possible future of memes?

CHAPTER OVERVIEW 
Following my exploration of the thesis’s origin, this document continues with: 
Chapter 2, a literature and contextual review which shapes the direction of 
speculation for possible futures of memes. It primarily examines historical 
evolution of meme, case studies on social media, economy of meme, Artificial 
Intelligence Algorithms, Blockchain technologies and NFTs, copyright and 
ownership of memes, Participatory Speculation and interactive documentary. 
Chapter 3 covers the methodologies and research methods that inform this 
project. It begins with identifying Historical and Economic Constructivism 
and Participatory Speculation as key methodologies implemented through 
the research.  Research methods that are applied include historical and 
Participatory Workshop, data collection and data analysis. 
Chapter 4 provides an overview of the methodologies and methods, 
specifying the happenings of the workshops, the study findings, and the 
process and outputs of the thesis project.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE AND CONTEXTUAL 
REVIEW 
In the following sections, I will review the literature pertinent to the research 
project with the intention to answer the primary research question. Firstly, I 
will address the “meme” concept, starting with a theoretical unit of cultural 
transmission and subsequent evolution to a digital artifact. This will be 
followed by a discussion of the case studies on social media in the framework 
of attention economy. The review will proceed with an overview of 
contemporary case studies of memes on social media and examine Artificial 
Intelligence created memes, NFT memes & Blockchain as well as the 
ownership and copyright of memes. It will also identify and define key 
concepts of Digital Participatory Culture relevant to research on meme 
studies. 
HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF MEMES 
FROM CULTURAL UNIT TO DIGITAL ARTIFACTS 
“Meme” is a term coined by biologist Richard Dawkins to describe the flow 
and flux of culture (Miler, 2016, p. 16). He defines the meme as "a unit of 
cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation” (Dawkins, 1976, p. 192) that carries 
15 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
ideas, symbols, or practices that can be transmitted from one mind to 
another by copying or imitation. Analogous to genes, memes have the 
characteristics of replicators that experience variation, competition, selection 
and retention (Dawkins, 1976). 
Scholarship on memes has historically relied on an “epidemiological model” 
(Weng, Flammini, Vespignani, & Menczer, 2012, p. 6). From an epidemiological 
stance, memetics is the cultural analogue to the study of how the virus 
spreads and diffuses through populations. One example is Kilroy Was Here, a 
meme that went viral and became popular during World War II, usually seen 
in graffiti. It depicted a man with an extended nose peeking over a wall, 
accompanied by the caption Kilroy Was Here (Shifman, 2014). Despite the 
contested origins of this meme, it proliferated throughout the places Allied 
forces were and beyond. The enigmatic nature and lack of a clear resolution 
allowed people to feel a sense of ownership over it, while also participating in 
a broader collective through sharing (Holm, 2021). Kilroy Was Here (Figure 1) 
also exemplifies the essence of participatory culture, which “encourages 
broad participation and grassroots creativity” (Jenkins, 2009). The simplicity of 
the drawing facilitated easy replication, as with Internet memes. Additionally, 
the meme's ambiguous meaning and interpretation contributed to its appeal 
and encouraged people's active involvement with it.

In the digital era, the Internet has enabled memes to rapidly disseminate 
across the world in a considerably short span. It is commonly understood that 
for a digital artifact to become an internet meme, it needs to go viral first 
(Shifman, 2015). With the evolution of Internet culture, the concept of the 
meme has undergone a semantic shift from its original definition, as 
individuals have adapted and modified the term to specifically reference 
online cultural artifacts (Chandler, 2013). The phrase “Internet meme” is 
commonly applied to describe “the propagation of content items such as 
jokes, rumors, videos, or websites from one person to others via the Internet” 
17 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
(Shifman, 2013, p.362). The diffusion of an Internet meme not only occurs in its 
original manifestation but also generates user-created derivatives, making 
memes the “quintessential participatory artifact: open, collaborative, and 
adaptable” (Milner, 2012, p. 12). Shifman finds it useful to define Internet 
memes by highlighting their three distinct natures: (a) a group of digital 
items sharing common characteristics of content, form, and/or stance, which 
(b) were created with awareness of each other, and (c) were circulated, 
imitated, and/or transformed via the Internet by many users (Shifman, 2015, 
p.41). 
Johnson asserts that memes may be of specific relevance for cultural analysis 
that focuses on interpreting the meaning of “seemingly superficial and trivial 
elements of popular culture” (Johnson, 2007, p. 27). He identifies and maps 
memetic dimensions of texts that have been labeled as successful Internet 
memes, with an eye toward examining whether Internet memes enrich our 
understanding of contemporary digital culture. Despite their seemingly facile 
presence, digital memes are rich with a variety of deep and broad meanings, 
serving as innovative forms of political and social expression. The use of 
memes on social media enables complex messages to be conveyed to large 
audiences. This phenomenon gives rise to what Shifman calls a “memeplex” 
(Shifman, 2015, p. 10). 
18 
 
 
 
 
  
The propagation of memes has been shifted into a ubiquitous process by the 
Internet, rather than any other communication medium, enabling the rapid, 
accurate, and widespread dissemination of memes through digital networks 
(Marshall, 1998). As a unique form of communication, memes possess a 
duality that encompasses individuality/collectivity and content (ideas and 
ideologies)/stance (the creator’s position in reference to the message). 
(Nissenbaum & Shifman, 2018). With content that features a visual format of 
images, GIF, or short videos, memes infuse humor into the creation and 
produce an emotional context (Posey et al., 2010). The potential for 
dissemination in terms of symbol construction and visual communication 
enables participants to apply them as a significant method for conveying 
emotions and expressions on social media (Wang et al., 2019). Therefore, the 
incorporation of Internet memes into dialogues enhance their expressive 
force and vivid information, compared to solely text-based communication 
(Fei et al., 2022). The notion of emotions is important to consider in the 
operation of memes as well. As Milner (2016) indicates, the propagation of 
memes is partly driven by their potential to evoke resonance among different 
Internet users at both an individual and societal level. By utilizing a shared 
base of meme templates that directs the creation of unique instances (Segev, 
Nissenbaum, Stolero, & Shifman, 2015), individuals can deliver a unique 
message with a collectively created formation (Phillips & Milner, 2017). 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
The individuality/collectivity duality is also manifest in meme creation and 
sharing and is relevant to the key features of participatory digital cultures 
(Newton et al., 2020). Scholars highlight that values serve as the fundamental 
building blocks for constructing our individual identity in relation to others, 
allowing us to continually negotiate and redefine our collective identity over 
time (Knight, 2010). Memes are not simply a reflection of existing societal-
cultural norms, they also serve as a medium for negotiating and constructing 
those values and norms (Gal et al., 2016), as well as shaping “the mindsets, 
forms of behavior, and actions of social groups” (Shifman, 2014, p. 18). 
Memes are commonly understood as either a shared language among 
members of online communities or as a social practice that underpins the 
processes of cultural production (Newton et al., 2022). Their creation and 
sharing incorporate the continual negotiation of shared values and beliefs 
(Procházka, 2018; Zappavigna, 2020). Shifman (2014) posits that meme 
sharing encompasses both distribution and communication. Distribution 
refers to the mere act of copying, pasting, forwarding, etc., while 
communication refers to the purposeful delivery of a message through 
sharing. This process of replication, through which the original meme 
becomes a reference text that is quoted and altered during its dissemination, 
known as intertextuality (Wigger & Bowers, 2014). The intertextual referencing 
of original memes to other memes can create a sense of belonging to online 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
communities as users leverage subcultural knowledge for interpretation and 
reappropriation (Laineste and Voolaid, 2016). 
CONTEMPORARY CASE STUDIES ON SOCIAL MEDIA 
I utilize the concept of the attention economy to discuss the technological 
change in online space that affects the creation and propagation of memes, 
as well as the creators. The economic significance of memes is associated 
with the attention economy, which is a prevalent feature of many 
contemporary societies (Davenport and Beck, 2001). The attention economy is 
an economic system in which human attention or time is considered the 
most valuable resource as attention converts to advertisements and other 
revenue. Essentially, the success of memes in the attention economy is 
dependent on their ability to capture and maintain people's attention. Social 
media has become a significant site for directing human attention in the past 
decade, bringing together the mediation of everyday life with technology 
that organizes and values communication practices (Rheingold, 2009). 
Fundamental values highlighted in the meme culture include creativity and 
freedom of information (Nissenbaum & Shiffman, 2018). In the realm of 
memes, creativity is a guiding principle of user participation and the concept 
of freedom of information is manifested not only in the vast array of topics 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
addressed by memes but also in the diverse genres of memes that transform 
personal acts into public information (John, 2016). The production of value on 
social media can be understood by examining the circulation of images and 
the management of participation and attention (Carah, 2014). In the context 
of the attention economy, visibility is considered a form of status (Marwick, 
2015). It is imperative for creators and users who aspire to succeed in social 
media platforms to cultivate visibility (William, 2018). The way of achieving 
visibility is facilitated by technological development in digital space. It can be 
achieved through various means, including active participation in online 
communities, the creation and dissemination of content, and the cultivation 
of a personal brand. Such visibility is seen as a valuable asset, as it increases 
the chances of capturing and retaining people's attention, and can result in 
increased opportunities, exposure, and success for meme creators. 
Memes perform important social functions in the web-based community 
such as “boundary policing, identity construction, and accumulation of 
cultural capital” (Literat & Van den Berg, 2017). Using the /b/board of 4chan 
(one of the original incubators for a huge number of memes) as an example, 
Nissenbaum and Shiffman assert that the connection between cultural 
capital and Internet memes is linked to the creative process and social 
dynamics surrounding memes on social media. "Meme literacy" affects a 
user's status in online communities and shows their membership. The use of 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
limited formulas to create memes is similar to Bourdieu’s concept of “cultural 
capital,” as determined by communal taste, which establishes acceptable 
forms of expression and results in social hierarchies among meme creators 
(Nissenbaum & Shiffman, 2015). In this case, the circulation of images on social 
media platforms is organized by users and their activities. Hashtags, tags, 
likes, and comments serve as quantitative markers of how web-based 
communities evaluate the worth of meme creation (Abisheva, Garcia, & 
Schweitzer, 2016). 
Figure 2. Main page of 4chan 
23 
 
 
 
The web-based community also manifests the process of construction of 
values and social structure that is moderated by users in the subculture 
community. By examining the MemeEconomy community on Reddit, where 
‘meme traders’ appropriate stock market terminology to discuss and 
appraise memes as objects of cultural exchange, Literat and van der Berg 
(2017) state that meme valuing and trading impacts community social 
structure, forming users into three categories: “meme insiders (those with the 
most savvy and authoritative valuations of memes), newcomers (those open 
to acquiring inside knowledge), and normies (those who appear to insiders as 
oblivious to this specialized discourse on memes). The meme insiders are not 
merely meme creators, but also cultural intermediaries (Bourdieu, 1984, p. 
101). In Bourdieu’s notion, cultural intermediaries serve as mediators in the 
cultural production process and in shaping the tastes of consumers in a 
limited cultural arena (Maguire & Matthews, 2010). The attainment of taste in 
memes and expertise in discoursing about their value function as cultural 
capital in maintaining a standing within the subreddit community. The 
memes traded in the MemeEconomy can be viewed as objects of cultural 
consumption, and through this consumption ‘fulfill a social function of 
legitimating differences’ (Bourdieu, 1984, p. 7). Experienced meme 
creators/insiders are required to differentiate themselves from outsiders, also 
known as “normies,” and to determine the value of memes within the 
imaginary meme economy. As Nissenbaum and Shifman (2017) put it, ‘the 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
deep connection between memes and the culture of some online 
communities means that they function as cues of membership, 
distinguishing in-group members from mere passersby’ (p. 485). 
Additionally, algorithms on social media platforms use a set of predetermined 
rules to regulate the circulation of images (Carah, 2014). These rules are not 
visible to users, but users can gain a general understanding of them through 
observation of the flow of content on the network (Eslami et al., 2015; Rader et 
al., 2018). The algorithms utilized by social media platforms are designed to 
manipulate behavioral norms through ‘constantly refining’ the “collecting, 
storing and processing of data” (Packer, 2013, p. 298) to produce valuable 
formations of attention. By establishing the conditions by which users are 
seen, algorithms serve as “disciplinary apparatuses that prescribe 
participatory norms” (Bucher, 2012; Cotter, 2019). 
In addition to evolving as a central hub for the dissemination of memes, 
algorithms on Youtube also made the diffusion, variation, and popularity of 
memes highly visible and transparent by consistently “aggregating and 
presenting the viewing habits, choices and responses generated by users'' 
(Shifman, 2011). YouTube content creators are contributing to the platform's 
value, but they possess limited power compared to both the platform and its 
algorithms (Van Dijck, 2009). Shifman (2011) highlights that a video meme is 
25 
 
 
 
 
frequently a "popular clip that lures extensive creative user engagement in 
the form of parody, pastiche, mash-ups, or other derivative work” (p. 190). This 
"extensive user involvement" is usually overlooked when evaluating the 
counts of “likes, views, and shares'', instead of taking into account the 
consideration of the “incredible amount of effort and labor that composes 
these cultural phenomena'' (Soha & McDowell, 2016). Thus, “the path to 
professionalization and monetization” necessitates initially gaining popularity 
on the platform, which is partially determined by the algorithm (Cunningham 
et al., 2016). With this algorithmic power existing as a fundamental 
contradiction for creators, content producers have to perceive visibility as a 
privilege and learn about the algorithm structure and develop tactics to 
respond to it. 
Through studying the content and users that achieve visibility, content 
creators also distinguish the participatory norms that algorithms ‘reward’ 
with visibility (Bucher, 2012). This opens up a broader space for meme 
diffusion as a “successful mode of marketing communication” (Malodia et al., 
2022) in several ways such as self-branding (Khamis et al., 2017), authenticity 
(Audrezet et al., 2018), and consumer engagement (Hughes et al., 2019). The 
algorithms on Instagram prominently value engagement, looking at different 
metrics as “positive engagement” (Tafesse & Wood, 2021), which includes 
profile clicks, comments, likes, reach-to-like ratio, saves, shares, time spent on 
26 
 
 
 
 
the photo, etc. Users of Instagram are encouraged both digitally and socially 
to participate in the imitation process through their consumption or 
interaction with meme marketing content (such as liking and sharing it), thus 
forming “a shared experience” within a digital community, presenting a 
perspective that aligns with the concept of brand publics. Meanwhile, the 
influencers are perceived as “playing a game” (Cotter, 2019) that captures 
disciplinary normalization via algorithms and perpetuates existing digital 
inequalities by bringing into focus “winner” and “loser” in algorithmic 
architecture. Recalling that Instagram influencers are reliant upon high 
visibility on the platform, they started to incorporate memes into their posts 
to build affinity with the intended audience, for the purpose of digital 
marketing or soliciting the attention of more users. This reinforces the 
mediatory role of Internet memes between the public and participatory 
culture on social media that bolster “ephemeral brand relationships or 
associations” (Arvidsson & Caliandro, 2016). Paquette (2019) reported that 
using memes in online marketing generates a 30% engagement rate on 
social media. Influencers and brands that engage in the creation and sharing 
of internet memes on social media platforms, motivated by shared interests, 
are considered members of an "imagined community" as defined by 
Anderson (2006). This sense of belonging is derived from a perception of 
being part of the same group, the digital meme culture, despite potentially 
never having had personal interactions 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Within Web 2.0 environments, memes effectively embody the dynamic remix 
culture (Burgess & Green, 2018). More specifically, users possess the capability 
to modify different elements of videos and recompose them to generate 
video mashups (Zulli & Zulli, 2020). This communicative process is rooted in 
the concept of “hyper-narrativity” (Wagener, 2019) and the “memefication of 
collective identities” (Ask & Abidin, 2017, p. 7), facilitating the “creation of 
discourse and content” on platforms such as TikTok, where the “humor, 
imitation, replication, and group affiliation” serve as dominant forces in these 
dynamics (Vizcaíno-Verdú & Abidin, 2021). Its content discovery centers on an 
algorithm recommender system that pushes trending videos, which shapes 
users’ practices surrounding visibility (Abidin, 2021). As this model of visibility 
is bound to proliferation through imitation, it shares the same memetic 
features with the way how memes propagate. The utilization of algorithmic 
analysis of user data within Tiktok has created a shift in the production and 
consumption of content on the platform, leading to potential ramifications 
for wider society (Zeng & Kaye, 2022). This step generates digital labels and 
recognizes digital modularity, encompassing elements such as memes, jokes, 
songs, and filters. The resultant data and forms derived from it are utilized by 
Tiktok to direct future consumption and production practices. This 
transformation challenges the traditional social media attention economy 
model, which has relied on human influencers as its primary attraction, by 
28 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
instead prioritizing content that has been categorized by digital modularity 
and labels (Liang, 2022). TikTok has advanced the concept of Internet memes 
by incorporating memes into its platform infrastructure (Shifman, 2013). 
Through this integration, Zulli and Zulli (2020) analyze the formation of 
imitation publics on TikTok, where networks are established through 
processes of imitation and replication, rather than through “interpersonal 
connections, expressions of sentiment, or lived experiences"(p. 1875). This 
new decentralized model of TikTok offers a promising solution to the 
hierarchy between creators resulting from the algorithms and shed light to 
an emerging creator-centered economy to catalyze a new wave of 
transformation within the creative industry. 
AI-CREATED MEMES 
The development of AI-generated memes can be traced to the early stages of 
computer science and AI research. Pioneering work in computer vision and 
natural language processing laid the foundation for subsequent 
advancements in the field. During the 2010s, the integration of deep learning 
algorithms and enhanced computational power enabled AI systems to 
generate a wide range of content, including memes. Initially, these AI-
29 
 
 
 
  
 
 
generated memes were simple combinations of text and images. Since then, 
AI-generated memes have become increasingly prevalent, with various 
companies and organizations utilizing this technology to create viral content 
and boost brand recognition. The growing popularity of AI-generated memes 
has also sparked important discussions about AI's role in society and its 
potential impact on cultural communication. 
In his essay "The Language of Internet Memes," Davison developed a three-
part methodology for analyzing Internet memes, comprising the ideal, the 
behavior, and the manifestation (Davison, 2009, p.122). According to Davison 
(2009), when constructing an image meme, the “Ideal” refers to the concept 
or message that the creator intends to convey. In the context of generating 
text-to-image memes, it can be considered as the textual description that the 
creator provides as input to the system. This input serves as the foundation 
for generating an image that accurately conveys the intended message or 
concept. The “Behavior” involves selecting an appropriate meme template 
and caption that effectively conveys the intended idea. Regarding text-to-
image meme generation, the automated selection of a suitable image 
template and the utilization of natural language processing and computer 
vision techniques to produce an image that aligns with the textual input 
provided would be essential steps. The final result of this process is referred to 
as the Manifestation, which would be the resulting image meme with a 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
caption that conveys the message embodied by the Ideal in AI meme 
generation. 
Davison’s methodology manifests a conceptualization process in meme 
creation, which is relevant to both text-based and image-based meme 
generation. The discipline developed by Davison provides a framework for 
understanding the process of meme creation. Scholars concentrate on the 
behavior and manifestation of a meme, whose method for generating image 
memes is confined to selecting the most matching meme caption or 
producing a caption for a given image and template name. (Peirson et al., 
2018; Wang & Wen, 2015). 
Other studies in the field of meme generation can be classified into two 
categories. One involves the automatic generation of memes based on text 
input, while the other pertains to the automatic generation of memes based 
on image input. Regarding meme generation based on text input, 
researchers conceptualize the creation of memes as a process of text 
translation. With the recent release of DALL-E in 2021, a neural network 
developed by OpenAI that can generate high-quality images from textual 
descriptions, the potential for text-based meme generation has expanded 
significantly. DALL-E uses a combination of computer vision and natural 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
language processing techniques to understand the textual input and 
generate corresponding images that match the description(Dayma, 2021). 
Figure 3. AI-generated Kermit Frog Images by Dall-E 
This AI image generator could revolutionize the way memes are created by 
enabling meme creators to generate images based on their text descriptions 
32 
 
 
 
 
without relying on pre-existing image templates (Grimes, 2022). The 
procedure entails feature extraction from the input text, followed by the 
utilization of a selection module to pick an appropriate meme template 
image from a list of well-known candidate images, based on the extracted 
features. Subsequently, the module generates the text from the chosen 
template image, culminating in the combination of the meme template 
image and the generated text (Sadasivam et al., 2020). In the approach to 
meme generation based on image input, Wang and Wen (2015) proposed a 
“meme-text sorting algorithm” that relies on “input image features and 
caption candidate features.” They initiate the process by conducting a reverse 
image search on the Internet to determine the most likely keyword 
associated with the input image. Soon after, they sourced other relevant 
caption candidates by searching for keywords on meme-searching websites. 
Finally, they applied the input image features to arrange the caption 
candidates through their algorithm, choosing the most appropriate caption 
generation result as the output caption for the input image. 
Furthermore, Vyalla and Udandarao (2020) introduced an end-to-end meme 
generation system that provides users with the ability to instantly create 
memes on web applications. The system trains a classification model to 
categorize the input image based on its own image class labeling, obtaining 
the image's class label, and then employs the label information to prompt the 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
generation model to produce captions. The system is designed to be able to 
handle a large number of meme templates and can generate high-quality 
memes by combining text and images in a variety of ways. With these 
exciting developments in the field of meme generation, creating and sharing 
memes has become a more accessible and efficient way for individuals to 
express their ideas and humor on various online platforms. 
MEME ECONOMY 
HISTORY OF MEME MONETIZATION 
Essentially, there were two economic models for attributing value to internet 
memes, namely, as a medium for generating advertising revenue on 
websites or social media accounts that feature memes (Lorenz, 2018), and as 
merchandise on physical or digital retail platforms, such as mugs, notebooks, 
shirts, and other related items (Jordan, 2011). The advertisement-based 
approach raised intriguing discussions about the economic value of memes 
and challenged the possibility of assigning monetary value to cultural 
construction (Elder-Vass, 2022). Notably, in September of 2007, investors 
purchased the meme aggregator website 'ICanHasCheezburger' from its 
creators for an incredible sum of $2 million, representing a meaningful 
moment in the evolution of the meme phenomenon as it was the first time 
34 
 
 
 
 
that such a considerable amount of money had been expended on the 
concept (Grossman, 2008). While the site had the potential to yield 
advertising revenue as a lucrative investment property over an extended 
period, contingent upon its ability to sustain its status as a platform that 
offers amusing and easily consumable content, there were also complex 
issues that merit further scrutiny. Chen (2012) posits a Marxist critique that 
these websites exploit their users by appropriating and publishing their 
memes to accumulate web traffic and generate revenue from advertising. 
These sites crowdsource the creation of content to their users, who produce it 
for free, presuming that they are cultivating a culture for the benefit of the 
platform. In reality, however, they are generating profits for the owners of 
these aggregation and dissemination platforms. 
Subsequently, within the subreddit r/MemeEconomy, a distinct and 
captivating community of individuals, known as "meme traders," engage in 
extensive discussions surrounding the fluctuations and trends within the 
"meme market"(Literat and van der Berg, 2017). Meme Economy is a “satirical 
concept and internet subculture in which memes are discussed in the 
jargons of the financial industry as if they are commodities or capital assets 
with fluctuating values” (Know your meme, 2016). The concept of the meme 
economy had emerged prior to the events surrounding Reddit’s 
/r/wallstreetbets and GameStop, a struggling video game retailer. Before the 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
idea of meme-driven stock investments was proposed by Reddit users, a 
thriving online real meme economy existed. However, it did not conform to 
the traditional definition of a market but instead resembled a market for 
memes in which no actual monetary exchange took place. (Sanderson & 
Rigby, 2013). In the meme economy, the performance of stocks or 
cryptocurrencies is more indicative of the traded assets’ “meme-ability”, 
which is their potential for meme transformation, rather than their ability to 
forecast business revenue. This investment strategy, which involves user-
created assets intended for mass dissemination, can be explained using 
Blackmore's theory of memes, which states that memes have the power to 
shape people's values and behaviors (Literat & Van den Berg, 2017). 
Traditional investment strategies have been predominantly influenced by 
established media outlets, such as television, radio, and top-down online 
publications. In contrast, the advent of meme investing has been fueled by 
user-generated investment strategies, facilitated by communication 
platforms such as Reddit and Twitter (Cuofano, 2019). Unlike ordinary goods 
and services, financial assets are dependent on the belief that they can be 
redeemed or sold in the future. This reliance necessitates an additional layer 
of social construction, which is integral to their existence. Thus, financial 
assets are not intrinsically valuable and are distinguished from other 
commodities by their dependence on collective belief (Elder-Vass, 2022).  
36 
 
 
 
 
  
Likewise, the meme culture manifests through “a process of collective, 
primarily anonymous, remixing of visual imagery via message boards and 
social media channels” (Dovey, 2019, p. 3). When the cultural value of memes 
is related to financial assets, such as stocks, Bitcoins or NFT, the financial 
assets become a store of cultural value and might be immensely valuable. In 
the 2016 US election cycle, memes were being shared in adjacent online 
forums as Bitcoin experienced an immense surge in value, growing from $13 
US at the start of 2013 to $18,000 US by the end of 2017. This period also 
witnessed the launch of thousands of alternative currencies, or alt-coins, as 
market capitalization rose and individuals engaged in collective speculation 
and trading of crypto-currencies against financial markets. 
The most well-known example is Dogecoin, a “combination of money and 
meme,” existing in two distinct spheres: the “financial economy” and the 
“cultural meme economy,” with the latter performing “unprecedented 
tangible impacts on the former'' (Nani, 2022, p. 1719). The distinctive cultural 
significance of Dogecoin portrays how Blockchain technology can effectively 
promote alternative monetary systems. The Doge meme originated in 
February 2010 after Japanese blogger Atsuko Sato shared a photo of her pet 
dog Shiba Inu Kabosu (Jeong, 2017). One of the photographs featured a 
distinctive image of Kabosu sitting on a sofa, staring askance at the camera 
with lifted eyebrows. Following articles published by The Verge, which 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
identified Sato's Kabosu as the source of the Shiba Inu represented in the 
meme, the image and content continued to obtain further online attention 
(Chayka, 2013). 
Figure 4. Doge (Meme) 
Figure 5. DogeCoin 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
In the following year, Doge attained a prominent cultural status and gained 
widespread recognition, to the point where corporations began to 
incorporate memes into their promotional campaigns (Bury, 2016, p. 36). The 
meme's broad appeal ultimately served as the inspiration for the 
development of a cryptocurrency known as Dogecoin, which was created by 
marketer Jackson Palmer and software developer Billy Markus. They 
capitalized on the psychological phenomenon of social proof, using the 
emotional investment that individuals have in a meme to amplify its 
influence as a “unique coalescence of meme and money” (Nani, 2022, p. 1728). 
The users of Dogecoin go beyond being mere cryptocurrency users; they 
engage with Doge as a cultural artifact that ‘constitute a cultural base that 
marks a commenter as part of... [a] community’ (Nissenbaum & Shifman, 2017, 
p. 497), and this approach has notable implications for Dogecoin's status as 
currency. One prominent campaign was that a group of enthusiastic 
supporters of the Jamaican bobsleigh team raised more than $25,000 in the 
cryptocurrency Dogecoin to enable the team to attend the Winter Olympics 
in Sochi (Hern, 2014). The convergence of memes and money is the distinctive 
feature that underlies Dogecoin's uniqueness and contributed to its viral 
spread (Jeong, 2017). 
The creation and diffusion within the meme culture is a collaborative process, 
independent of competitive and economic motivations. The advent of 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
Blockchain technology, however, has introduced a platform for the 
acquisition or exchange of digital objects through Non-Fungible Tokens 
(NFTs), thereby establishing a new value system that provides meme creators 
with an opportunity for recognition and compensation with trading memes. 
Blockchain, which was first proposed by Nakamoto (2008), is a decentralized 
ledger maintained by decentralized nodes that are utilized for distributed 
sharing and storing of data. Blockchain originated from Bitcoin, a distributed 
ledger system that needs everyone to participate collectively and maintains 
the transcript of the entire value-transaction history. The structure of 
Blockchain technology is underpinned by four fundamental principles, 
namely persistence, decentralization, auditability, and anonymity (Gururaj et 
al., 2020). 
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which are cryptographic tokens based on 
Blockchain technology, serve to signify ownership of singular content, 
including images, videos, and 3D objects. Although NFTs have gained 
immense popularity and their trading prices have surged, scant information 
is available regarding people's attitudes towards and encounters with NFTs 
(Sharma et al., 2022). The emergence of NFTs has ushered in a novel revenue 
stream centered on memes. An example is the sale of an NFT depicting the 
well-known photograph of the little girl in the Disaster Girl meme, which 
fetched a price of over $400,000. Zoë Roth, the individual in the photograph, 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
expressed surprise upon discovering that NFTs could offer a means of 
capitalizing on her online renown (Fazio, 2021). 
Figure 6. The Disaster Girl meme 
Blockchain technology enables communication to evolve from the Internet of 
Information to the Internet of Value, “where a collection of protocols can 
transfer information in the form of bits and bytes over different physical 
media, can be used to transmit assets that can be expressed in monetary 
terms” (Treiblmaier, 2023, p. 5). One of Blockchain’s innovative promises is to 
forge “digital scarcity” (Nofer et al., 2017, p. 183); It replicates real-world 
economics, where products and services are not equally free. A digital asset 
can be coded to become a permanent limited supply. The success of specific 
41 
 
 
 
 
NFTs presents intriguing questions regarding the meaning of "value" and 
"scarcity" within the framework of Blockchain technology (Chohan, 2021). 
Operating on a digital platform, NFT trading is situated within “two-sided 
markets dominated by network externalities" (Pawelzik, 2022). Network 
effects, being defined as “the increasing utility that a user derives from 
consumption of a product as the number of other users who consume the 
same product increases" (McGee & Sammut-Bonnici, 2015), are deeply rooted 
in the process of platform usage and adoption by its users (Pawelzik, 2022). 
Vasan et al (2022) propose that the value of an NFT is driven by strong 
network effects between creators and their collectors. As the adoption and 
usage of NFT continue to grow, either creators or collectors are experiencing 
rising benefits. The expansion of the user base leads to greater liquidity, 
demand, and prospects for purchasing and repurchasing NFTs.  Creators who 
sell their work in the NFT world also noticed that the value of their creative 
work is not fundamentally determined by its aesthetic qualities, but rather by 
the community surrounding it (Bruner, 2021). 
The NFT marketplace exhibits a growing trend of active community 
formation. A multitude of online communities and forums cater to NFT users, 
including Discord channels associated with popular NFT projects, as well as 
NFT trading platforms such as Rarible, Foundation, and Opensea. The 
congregation of individuals with a shared interest creates a platform for NFT 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
creators to showcase their achievements and principles to the public 
(Sharma, 2022). Some NFT creators have observed that art transacted 
through NFT exhibits an interesting resemblance to memes in its 
dependence on community (Gloerich, 2022). However, “instead of creating 
scarcity, NFT markets appear to prioritize virality as a source of value, 
especially when it comes to memes. The more viral a meme is, in the NFT 
meme economy, the greater the value of the meme” (Lantagne, 2022, p. 286). 
Lantagne further argues that memes are poised to be commodified entities 
in “a space where value is based on the community” (Lantagne, 2022, p. 290). 
Unlike an individual work of art, a digital artifact can only “become a meme 
because it is replicated and shared” (Lantagne, 2022, p.290). The existence of a 
meme is fundamentally reliant on the presence of a community, given its 
underlying dependence on virality. Thus, the perceived value of an NFT 
meme is positively correlated with the degree of its ubiquity and virality. 
CREATOR OWNERSHIP 
COPYRIGHT OF HUMAN-CREATED MEMES 
Marciszewski (2020) details two profound questions that are closely 
connected to this thesis: 
43 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
(1) Does the use of pre-existing content in a newly created meme constitute 
copyright infringement by the meme creators? 
(2) Do creators of memes hold copyright ownership over their works in the 
context of the rising commercialization of meme content? 
The scholarship that I explore in this section aims to answer these two 
questions. 
Internet memes have emerged as prevalent digital cultural artifacts for mass 
communication and public participation. Several legal scholars have put forth 
the argument that memes, as expressions of internet culture, should be 
separated from copyright liability due to their dependence on the 
participatory nature of their development (Patel, 2013). The European Union 
Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market adopted a similar line of 
reasoning and exempted memes and GIFs from the new regulations.  In 
general, if an individual is sharing a meme as a form of expression on social 
media or other online platforms, concerns about infringement are relatively 
minimal. According to Smith and Lantagne (2021), social media platforms, 
such as Instagram or Twitter, have obtained licenses through their terms of 
service that authorize other users of the platform to share memes with other 
users through the service's functionalities. Additionally, these platforms have 
44 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
implemented DMCA notice and takedown procedures to safeguard against 
copyright infringement claims of secondary liability. 
Nowak points out that memes are a hybrid form of media, combining 
“indirect authorship by the culture industry” (i.e., producers of the original 
movies, cartoons, songs, etc.) and “direct authorship by active media 
audiences that reproduce these culture products with digital tools in order to 
create new meanings (possible readings) and propagate them horizontally 
across the internet” (Nowak, 2016, p. 83). Therefore, memes thrive in a gray 
zone of intellectual property protection where creativity and innovation 
bloom in spite of the lack of protection provided by Intellectual Property 
regulations and copyright laws. 
As the popularity of memes increases, so do concerns about their legal status 
and implications under copyright law. Any attempt to restrict the production 
of memes through legal measures that fail to recognize them as a visual 
language could risk hampering online political and civic participation, which 
are essential principles of remix culture (Lessig, 2008). Though the 
collaborative character of memes represents a challenge to copyright law, 
memes as a communication tool with their specific logic and grammar 
(Milner, 2016) should be protected by copyright law (Mielczarek & Hopkins, 
2020). According to the Copyright Act of 1976 in the US, internet memes may 
45 
 
 
 
  
 
 
be classified either as a "derivative work" or a "compilation." Internet memes 
are viewed as "derivative works" as Internet users add participatory creativity 
to pre-existing copyrighted works to produce new material, while memes 
that utilize more than one copyrighted work, such as ones juxtaposing 
images from different sources, are classified as "compilations" (Copyright Act, 
1976). 
According to Malaton (2019), the most important piece of law to meme-
creators is the Fair Use Doctrine, a part of the Copyright Act. If meme creators 
utilize pre-existing memes or modify them in a way that creates a new 
meaning, such creators may be able to avail themselves of copyright 
infringement through the fair use of creativity which that law is designed to 
foster. Due to the transformative nature of memes and their minimal impact 
on the market value of the original material, a court would likely conclude 
that internet memes constitute a defense. There are four factors that courts 
weigh when determining if the appropriation of a prior work without 
permission is acceptable: purpose and character of the derivative work, 
nature of the original copyrighted work, amount and substantiality of original 
work used in the derivative work, effect on the market (Copyright Law, 1976). 
The fair use doctrine “permits and requires courts to avoid rigid application of 
the copyright statute when, on occasion, it would stifle fair use, following a 
46 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
comprehensive weighing of the relevant factors under the doctrine of fair 
use" (Marciszewski, 2020). 
Additionally, as mentioned in the previous section, the rising popularity of 
memes has created opportunities for individuals to obtain economic returns 
from making memes, and enterprises and corporations have dedicated 
segments of their marketing teams to working with meme creators, 
employing memes as promotional instruments to capture the attention of 
their consumers. However, the problem arises when larger meme-posting 
social media pages steal the creative work of meme creators with less fame 
and fortune (Marciszewski, 2020). Marciszewski (2020) highlights the 
F*ckJerry account as one of the most notorious of these meme-stealing 
pages, making a significant amount of money per sponsored meme post. The 
success of these meme-stealing pages has sparked concerns about the 
“theft” surrounding internet memes and the legal protection of meme 
creators. Meme creators have expressed their legitimate requirement for 
credit and compensation for their intellectual property, but without legal 
recourse, they are left powerless to protect their creative works from being 
stolen without recognition or compensation. Establishing legal copyright 
protections for internet memes also helps address these concerns and 
protect the rights of meme creators. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COPYRIGHT OF AI-CREATED MEMES 
With the rise of AI systems capable of mimicking human creativity and 
producing original work, copyright laws are facing new and unexplored 
territory driven by AI, ethicists, lawyers, and regulators are scrambling to 
understand how innovations will spark new creativity in human society 
(Ihalainen, 2018). Many diverse definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) exist in 
the academic literature (Domingos, 2015; Poole et al., 1998; Russell & Norvig, 
2010). However, for the current context, the most appropriate interpretation 
of AI can be characterized as “an entity sufficiently simulating the cognitive 
aspects of human thinking” (Zibner, 2019). The simulation of human 
intelligence involves both automated learning and automated reasoning. 
Automated learning pertains to the process by which AI systems acquire 
information and apply predetermined rules for using that information. 
Automated learning refers to “the process by which AI systems acquire 
information and apply predetermined rules for using that information” 
(Selvadurai & Matulionyte, 2020, p. 536). Along with the same line, Guadamuz 
(2021) notes that “we are getting to the point at which vital creative decisions 
are not made by humans, rather they are the expression of a computer 
learning by itself based on a set of parameters pre-determined by 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
   
programmers” (p.148). With the proliferation of machines capable of 
mimicking human creativity and producing original work, the landscape of 
copyright has been pushed into a novel and unexplored territory that is 
driven by artificial intelligence. 
The growing presence of artificial intelligence poses a technological 
challenge to copyright law (Zibner, 2019), addressing the issues of “whether 
copyright can subsist in a work generated using AI” (Selvadurai, & 
Matulionyte, 2020, p. 536) and “who will hold the copyright in these works” 
(Ihalainen, 2018). Today, ChatGPT4 starkly foregrounds this reality with its 
capacities of data aggregation and image from text generation, showcasing 
the potential of AI systems to produce original works that could potentially 
blur the lines of ownership and copyright law, leaving ethicists, lawyers, and 
regulators with new challenges to navigate. 
Selvadurai and Matulionyte (2020) explain that “in [the] case of AI-generated 
work, natural persons or legal entities are involved at undertaking 
arrangements necessary for the creation of the work” (Selvadurai & 
Matulionyte, 2020, p. 540), outlining the diverse potential patterns and levels 
of interaction between humans and machines in AI-generated and 
identifying human input in three stages of computational creation: (1) 
selection and classification of data (2) creation of AI work (3) checking and 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
delivery of final AI work. The notion is proposed that in cases where human 
intervention is restricted to the mere selection and categorization of data, the 
output work cannot be regarded as original under copyright law, as it does 
not reflect the independent intellectual exertion of a human author. 
Figure 7. Harry Potter Memes created by Midjourney with prompt offered by human 
Yanisky and Moorhead (2017) further state that ten essential attributes of 
algorithms are incorporated in artificial intelligence (AI) systems that create 
artwork, including “creativity, autonomous and independent, unpredictable 
and new results, capable of data collection and communication with outside 
50 
 
 
 
 
data, learning capability, evolving, rational-intelligent system, free choice and 
goal-oriented” (Yanisky & Moorhead, 2017, p. 681). They are critical to the 
copyright discourse on AI system accountability. Most AI systems incorporate 
any or all of these ten features, which are interrelated and partly overlapping. 
By utilizing such features, AI systems are capable of autonomously 
generating works of creative art. As we acquire a deeper understanding of 
these attributes and the autonomous nature of AI-produced output, it is 
evident that the copyright privileges afforded to human authors may not be 
exclusive, giving rise to prospective complications in implementing 
traditional copyright statutes. As technological advancements continue, AI 
systems are progressively capable of replicating aspects of creativity once 
deemed intrinsic to human minds. 
Based on the existing framework of U.S and Europe copyright laws that are 
unprepared and irrelevant for AI-generated creative work, Yanisky and 
Moorhead (2017) propose a new accountability model, called the AI Work 
Made for Hire (WMFH) model, viewing the AI system as a creative employee 
or independent contractor of the user. This framework would attribute 
ownership, control, and responsibility to the individuals or legal entities 
utilizing AI systems. It uncovers the capabilities of AI systems, thus effectively 
imposing accountability on identifiable individuals or legal entities. Likewise, 
Birdy suggests that AI authorship can be accommodated within the existing 
51 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
copyright framework by utilizing the "work made for hire" doctrine in the 
future. This doctrine enables copyright ownership to be granted to a legal 
person that is not the actual author of the work. This legal fiction 
acknowledges the creative contributions of generative code, while also 
recognizing that such creativity is distinct from that of its human coder. 
Using AI to generate creative work involves a preliminary step of gathering a 
substantial corpus of training data, followed by the production of 
intermediary iterations of the data (Gillotte, 2020). These serve the purpose of 
training the AI program as its algorithm undergoes continuous refinement 
over time (Bonadio & Mcdonagh, 2020). In the context of AI-generated works, 
“copyright infringement claims could arise in two neural-network-based 
machine-learning scenarios” (Gillotte, 2020, p. 2671).  The first scenario 
involves an engineer's unauthorized digitization and reproduction of 
copyrighted works to create a digital corpus of training data, which violates 
the copyright owner's exclusive right to reproduce their work. The second 
scenario entails the unauthorized production of intermediate copies of 
images during the training process of neural networks such as CNNs or GAN's 
discriminative model, which can also lead to claims of copyright infringement 
(Sobel, 2017). 
52 
 
 
 
  
  
Unlike older types of generative neural networks that necessitate the use of 
intermediate copies to learn, the GAN's generative model has the ability to 
produce images without such intermediary steps (Serban et al., 2016). This 
development poses new challenges to human creators. A New York-based 
group of artists has filed a lawsuit against Artnome, alleging that the 
company utilized generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create new 
works that are "substantially similar" to those of the artists, thus infringing on 
their copyrights. The artists are seeking damages and an injunction to 
prevent Artnome from using their work in the future. The lawsuit highlights 
the legal implications of utilizing AI in the creative industries, and the need to 
provide legal protections for artists whose work is reproduced without their 
consent. (Pimentel, 2023). 
The rising “sophistication of generative software” and the fact that “all 
creativity is algorithmic compel recognition" that AI-generated works exhibit 
less heterogeneity with respect to their human-authored counterparts and 
existing copyright laws than what meets the eye (Birdy, 2016, p. 27). The 
concept of AI authorship can easily fit into the existing copyright system by 
utilizing the "work made for hire" doctrine (Birdy, 2016, p. 27). This principle 
enables the transfer of copyright ownership to a legal entity, even if that 
entity is not the actual creator of the work. 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COPYRIGHT OF NFT MEMES 
The features of Blockchain and NFT make it an innovative solution for code 
copyright management and the ownership of memes. In a Blockchain 
network, transactions are validated by a community of nodes and then 
recorded in a block, which consists of two parts: a block header and a block 
body (Priyadarshini, 2019). The block header comprises “the hash of the 
previous block, the timestamp of the current time, nonce, specified difficulty 
and Merkle root of a group of transactions. The block body contains 
“information about the transactions” (Liang, 2019, p. 122). Each block in the 
Blockchain is linked to the previous block through a peer-to-peer network. 
Recognizing the potentially transformative effects that Blockchain networks 
could bring to the organization of the internet and society, several Blockchain 
platforms emerged and attracted enormous attention from the financial, 
medical and digital fields (Nani, 2022). One of the developments was the 
creation of Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, which are authenticated digital and 
Blockchain-verified assets (Popsecu, 2021), resembling cryptocurrency since 
they rely on a decentralized authentication process conducted through a 
network of nodes. 
54 
 
 
 
There are two different approaches to intellectual property rights and 
ownership structure for digital content within the context of NFTs. The first 
one is the original ownership, to which NFT serves as a means to ascertain 
the "provenance" of digital artifacts, supplying pertinent information 
including the identity of the original creator, the chronology of ownership for 
a given digital artifact, and the extant copies of said artifact, thereby shedding 
light on its relative scarcity (Sharma et al., 2022). The latter one is collective 
ownership, which refers to fractional NFTs that allows multiple individuals or 
entities to own, share, and collaborate on the creation, distribution, and 
governance of NFT content (Mukhopadhyay & Ghosh, 2021). This model is 
centered around the idea that digital content, like memes, is often an artifact 
of collective creation and shared cultural experiences. Scholars suggest that 
NFTs have the potential to empower artists and creators in the monetization 
of digital artwork online (Çağlayan & Özkan, 2021; Okonkwo, 2021; Rafli, 2022), 
but they also require careful consideration and responsible use to ensure that 
existing power imbalances in the art world will not be further entrenched 
(Rafli, 2022). The utilization of NFTs can facilitate art creators in registering 
their works for sale through an intelligent contract framework, whereby the 
ownership of the work is transferred to the new proprietor along with the 
verification of a digital certificate (Sharma et al., 2022). Creators employ NFTs 
to acquire funding directly from their supporters or investors and to 
effortlessly enforce their resale rights. When combined with an extensive 
55 
 
 
 
 
repository of works, these two functions have the potential to enable NFTs to 
create an unprecedented possibility for making the 'remix culture' 
commercially feasible. This outcome could decrease the need for copyright 
enforcement and leverage the unbridled circulation of information to the 
profit of creators (Bajčetić 2020). In the meme context, despite being “a 
powerful tool to protect artists’ rights” (Histed et al., 2021), the beneficiaries of 
NFTs are typically the subjects or entities featured in the artwork, as opposed 
to the artists responsible for creating them. 
The fundamental purpose of copyright law has always been to establish 
scarcity, resulting in creating artificial scarcity when virality poses a risk (Genc, 
2021). The same application of scarcity underlies NFT’s challenges on the 
Internet. According to Fisher, “NFT represents something unique and, along 
with providing verifiable authenticity and ownership, creates digital scarcity” 
(Fisher, 2019, p. 631). The core value of NFTs stems from their perceived rarity 
and legitimacy, which appeals to buyers seeking assurance that their NFTs 
are both genuine and unique. However, despite some NFT marketplaces 
claiming that attached works are scarce, this is frequently not the case in 
practice, with countless works being instantly available in identical forms 
across multiple platforms (Bennett & Koblinsky, 2021). Consequently, the 
purported scarcity of NFTs is often artificial. It is noteworthy that when 
creators sell NFT entities, they are selling copies of the artwork rather than 
56 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
the underlying work itself, with the NFTs serving as proof of ownership for the 
copy (Berg, 2021). As a result, other copies of the artwork persist, and they can 
be freely copied and shared, particularly in the realm of memes. 
As was mentioned in the previous section regarding the monetization of NFT 
memes, the perceived value of an NFT meme is positively correlated with the 
degree of its ubiquity and virality. And the value of the NFT memes is tied to 
their associated community, given their fundamental dependence on virality. 
This configuration of the meme NFT challenges current notions of copyright 
law in two prominent ways. Firstly, the discussions relating to NFT auctions of 
memes presume that the subject depicted in the meme, rather than the 
owner of the copyright, holds the right to auction off the meme NFTs. 
Secondly, NFT auctions prioritize the aspect of virality over scarcity, as the 
memes that enjoy wider circulation and recognition are accorded higher 
value (Lantagne, 2022). 
However, NFTs indeed offer a prospective solution to the problem of proving 
ownership of memes, which are frequently circulated without regard for their 
creators, coupled with companies' growing use of memes in marketing 
(Sundlöf, 2022). By using NFTs, creators can provide proof of ownership 
without limiting accessibility, offering a new way for artists to monetize their 
work in digital space. More importantly, NFTs have enabled unprecedented 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
compensation opportunities for meme creators within the prevailing 
copyright framework, igniting expressions of awe and appreciation. 
CONTEXTUAL WORKS 
INTERACTIVE DOCUMENTARY 
Through the creation of an interactive documentary, this study aims to 
address pertinent research questions of how  interactive documentary can be 
used to imagine the possible future of memes. This section offers an overview 
of interactive documentaries, with the aim of comprehending the existing 
landscape and identifying areas for new contributions. The contextual works 
section is segmented into two subsections: interactivity and narrative form. 
The interactivity subsection examines how an interactive timeline is used as 
nonfiction storytelling and experience giving the audience an active role in 
the whole process. The narrative form section investigates the forking path 
narrative related to my own undertaking. 
Intuitively, the interactivity of interactive documentary refers to the capacity 
for “responsiveness, exchange, and adaptation” (Nash, 2022, p. 7). Within the 
context of digital media, this concept underscores a defining feature of 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
computing technology: namely, the ability of computers to react to the 
actions and inputs of individuals utilizing the technology. According to Nash, 
interactive documentaries might extend documentary media’s civil role 
beyond the domain of public knowledge. It can function as a tool for 
community projects addressing mutual social and economic problems, or 
even a platform for political engagement creating a civil culture and fostering 
dialogic spaces (Nash, 2015). 
In exploring the relationship between reality, interactivity and participation in 
the interactive documentary, one of the compelling works that I examined is 
Warsaw Rising 1944. This project invites viewers to engage with the critical 
chapter in Poland's history during World War II, covering different historical 
periods in chronological order. The documentary employs a range of 
interactive features, such as the timeline to navigate different time spans, 
animated maps and data visualizations, and first-hand accounts from 
survivors of the uprising. By offering these interactive features, viewers are 
able to actively participate in the construction of their own understanding of 
the event, rather than passively consuming information. This participatory 
approach not only promotes a deeper engagement with the subject matter 
but also encourages critical thinking and reflection on the complexities of 
historical events. 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 8. Photo galleries and audio-recordings that illustrates the invasion of Poland 
My project also utilizes interactive features, such as an index, a timeline, and 
animation galleries, to present the historical trajectory of technological 
breakthroughs and economic innovation that affect the creation and 
propagation of memes, and the participatory speculated future of meme 
creators' ownership. Besides the possibility to view the documentary in its 
standard sequence by scrolling the page, it is intriguing to embrace the 
constant presence of an index on the bottom band. Having this in-built 
interaction mechanism to indicate the start of exploration, viewers can more 
freely choose the investigation through the map or continue to seek statistics 
or pictures without having to navigate through the challenges and confusion 
that is often appearing when people face an overload of new information. 
60 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Overall, Warsaw Rising 1944 stands as a compelling illustration of the 
potential of interactive engagement and participation to augment the appeal 
of documentary narratives. 
In terms of narrative form, a prevalent structure in database narratives is the 
'forking path' form, which derives inspiration from Borges's work "The Garden 
of Forking Paths," and its potential for labyrinthine storytelling. This narrative 
form incorporates one or more decision points, which broaden the storyline 
to generate multiple parallel plots (Nash, 2022). One example of an interactive 
documentary that employs a forking path narrative is Hollow created by 
Elaine McMillion Sheldon and her team. Hollow is a participatory 
documentary that explores the impact of the economic decline of rural towns 
in the United States, particularly in West Virginia. The documentary is 
structured around the stories of residents from McDowell County, who share 
their experiences of living in a region that has been devastated by a range of 
challenges, including job loss, depopulation, and environmental degradation. 
61 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9. Interactive documentary Hollow tells a story of population decline in the rural U.S. 
By utilizing a forking path narrative structure, Hollow invites viewers to select 
different stories and perspectives, as well as to access additional background 
information and interactive features, such as exploration maps and data 
visualizations. This structure encourages engagement with the material, 
enabling viewers to explore the complex factors that have contributed to the 
decline of rural communities in the US. Through its innovative use of 
interactive technology, Hollow provides a compelling example of how the 
forking path narrative form can be leveraged to enhance the impact of 
documentary storytelling. The use of forking path narrative also inspires my 
work, which is a database narrative documentary that leverages the form to 
allow viewers to select different stories and perspectives, and to access 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
additional background information and interactive features, to explore the 
complex factors that have contributed to the techno-economic development 
of meme monetization history. 
Overall, the contextual works provide a compelling framework for 
understanding the potential of interactivity and narrative form in 
documentary storytelling, and my project for this thesis builds upon this 
framework to present a unique and innovative approach to the possible 
futures of meme creators' ownership. 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
CHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGIES AND METHODS 
Unpredictable Memes makes use of two methodologies: Economic 
Constructivism and Participatory Speculation to address its research 
question, seeking how these methodologies can be employed to imagine 
possible futures based on the historical development of techno-economic 
changes that affect meme creators. The following chapter details a variety of 
critical, speculative and participatory methodologies and methods. 
METHODOLOGIES 
ECONOMIC CONSTRUCTIVISM 
Economic Constructivism refers to the philosophical and theoretical 
foundations of economics and the methods used to study and analyze 
economic phenomena (Backhouse, 2008). I employ this methodology to 
consider the history of meme monetization, the switch of values of memes, 
and the aftermath of AI and NFT affects the meme creators' ownership, in a 
way that echoes the exploration of scholarly works in the section literature 
review. The approach that I take is Economic Constructivism, a theoretical 
approach that facilitates an individual’s immersion into the illustration of the 
economic reality and elucidates this reality based on how an individual 
perceives and constructs the world around him or her. 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Popkov defines Economic Constructivism as the “deliberate construction of 
economic reality in accordance with the axiological preferences of a social 
subject (whether individual or collective), which takes into account the 
structural and parametric interfacing of subject and object on the basis of the 
principles of self-reference, duality, circularity and cyclical causality” (Popkov, 
2017). This implies a deliberate construction of economic reality, which 
implies that economic systems are not natural or inevitable, but rather 
constructed and shaped by human beings based on their values and 
preferences. It also highlights the principles of self-reference, duality, 
circularity, and cyclical causality, suggesting that economic systems are not 
linear or unidirectional, but rather dynamic and interdependent. 
In the case of technological change on social media platforms and meme 
monetization, the quote conveys that changes in economic models and 
incentive models may also have a feedback loop effect on the behavior of 
meme creators and consumers, as well as the technologies and platforms 
that influence meme distribution and monetization. The perspective of 
Economic Constructivism posits that economic reality is not purely objective 
but is instead a product of individuals' subjective experiences and 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interpretations shaped by changes in their internal and external 
environments. Upon the completion of the Economic Constructivism 
approach, the visions obtained can be utilized as a fundamental basis for 
forecasting the future of memes through Participatory Speculation. 
By incorporating Economic Constructivism for the analysis of meme 
monetization and creator ownership into the framework of Participatory 
Speculation, it becomes possible to envision various future scenarios 
regarding the monetization and ownership of memes. Such scenarios can 
provide a thought-provoking and engaging way to explore the potential 
future of memes based on an economic perspective of the meme as digital 
artifacts. The concepts and materials gained through this process are realized 
as visual elements of an interactive timeline in the thesis output. 
PARTICIPATORY SPECULATION 
This research project is principally focused on meme creators' ownership 
within the influence of technologies. Participation in meme creation 
intertwines collective nature and social-communicative bonds, thus, memes 
can be seen as the “cultural embodiment” of the so-called “networked 
individualism” (Yhee et al., 2021). The meme culture cannot exist without the 
66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
creation and sharing by meme creators. Also, given the fact that current 
theoretical research might not cover the application of AI and Blockchain to 
date, it is necessary to invite experts from related fields to the discussion and 
bring diverse voices to the conversation. 
The Participatory Speculation Methodology combines the framework of 
Participatory Design with Speculative Methodology . Participatory Design 
(PD) is an approach to research and design by imagining and creating 
alternative sociotechnical scenarios that challenge our status quo, opening 
up debates and discussions about current and emerging issues. In two 
decades, it has moved from the fringes to the mainstream of design theory 
and practice. One of the most significant ways in which the evolution of 
speculative design over the past decade is its opening up to more 
participatory approaches. The participatory features encourage the 
democratic ideals to “emphasize the right to maintain a different opinion 
than those in power, to forward opposing positions, and to build knowledge 
on an alternative basis to support a different view” (Bjerknes & Bratteteig, 
1994). It intends to explore and develop different opinions when the 
surrounding context supports a singular dominant narrative. In the context of 
speculative design, the participatory approach opens up possibilities for 
people to gather and think about, imagine in creating their preferable 
futures. Participatory Speculation creates a discursive space where thoughts, 
67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
needs, and desires, unanticipated by designers and researchers, can be 
expressed by participants. Coming face-to face with different individuals 
“demands work, speculative invention and ontological risk. No one knows 
how to do this in advance of coming together in composition”(Haraway, 2008, 
p. 83). It is important to make space for the unanticipated, in which designers 
and participants can communicate in a “mutuality of unfamiliarity” (Muller, 
2009, p. 1067). 
METHODS 
Since meme culture embraces a shared and collective expression among 
Internet creators, the speculation process is designed to be two-fold: 
Individually through a historical analysis and group through a Participatory 
Workshop. The historical analysis covers more on the status quo, looking at 
the historical evolution of memes, analyzing how AI algorithms and 
Blockchain turn memes from cultural expression to profitable information 
products. For the purpose of seeking possible futures of memes, I combine 
participatory design approach with speculative design practices to enable 
diverse voices in the discussion. Participants are invited to engage in this 
research through employing E-mail recruitment strategy that uses my 
university E-mail account as the sender (see Appendix A - E-mail Invitation).  
The overall number of participants required for the workshop is 5-8, with a list 
68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of 30 potential participants to ensure that additional participants can be 
reached out to if any current participants dropped from the workshop.  I 
searched for creators who have written articles about memes within different 
professional fields, directly contacting them with E-mail. 
The REB application was approved on February 3rd, 2022, and I initiated the 
recruitment strategy shortly after then. To participate in the study, interested 
individuals are identified as professional experts in different fields including 
Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, NFT, meme creation and academic writing, 
and have sufficient knowledge in memes. 
HISTORICAL ANALYSIS 
Why do we need to look at history, if the goal is to speculate about the 
future? By exploring historical and current trends and development and 
learning their progression over time, we can open up new perspectives when 
imagining the future. Historical analysis is an effective research method that 
can “shed new light on recurring cultural themes embedded in technology” 
(Wyche et al., 2006). In this regard, it can be applied to the study of the history 
of meme monetization and the change of copyright of memes as digital 
artifacts. To conduct such a study, a literature review of relevant scholarship is 
necessary. By incorporating insights and viewpoints from interdisciplinary 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
research on meme creation, propagation and monetization within the 
literature review, a foundation of material is established for conducting a 
historical analysis. Historical research and analysis are selected as a method 
to investigate the effect of technologies on the propagation of memes and 
the relationship between disruptive technologies (specifically AI and 
Blockchain) and the monetization of memes. Firstly, it examines the different 
values of memes including cultural, social and economic values based on 
case studies on social media platforms. Secondly, the historical analysis can 
help identify the key players in the progress of meme monetization, such as 
algorithms, platforms, advertisers, and meme consumers, uncovering their 
roles in shaping the monetization and ownership of memes. Thirdly, this 
approach can be utilized to investigate the potential correlation between 
technological advancements and the evolution of the economic model of 
memes. 
By examining the economic and technological factors that shape the 
production, distribution, and consumption of memes, this approach offers a 
comprehensive framework for analyzing the complex interplay between 
these two domains. Such an investigation can provide valuable insights into 
the ways in which meme creators have adapted to changing technological 
environments and the impact of such adaptations on their motivation for 
creation. Combining perspectives and insights from different fields within the 
70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
historical analysis, I build up knowledge of significant technological influence 
on the creation and distribution of memes which help create a starting 
foundation for the speculation. 
APPLYING PARTICIPATORY SPECULATION: WORKSHOP 
A workshop session is a research method that brings people together to 
brainstorm and collaboratively speculate on the topic of the possible future of 
memes. Five participants were required in this session. In this workshop, I 
presented 2-3 provocations from the literature review that participants can 
engage with. Participants were selected from experts in different fields related 
to memes, including AI, Blockchain, NFTs, meme creation, and meme scholars. 
The role of participants will be to engage in a 1-hour online workshop on Miro. 
The qualitative approach will consist of two parts: 1) focus group discussion and 
2) Participatory Speculation. 
1. The focus group is a way to explore the future of memes from experts’ 
experience and perspective. In this part, participants will be asked to do 
individual speculation based on the questions provided and have a 
discussion. The ideas they generated were a starting point for the next part. 
2. Participatory Speculation aims to explore how to build an engaging, 
interactive path from now to the speculative future. They used notes on Miro 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to create the future of a fictional universe (in this case, the universe of future 
memes) starting with the broadest strokes of the future and then narrowing 
down to specific events and scenes featuring technologies, including AI and 
Blockchain. Participants were expected to collaboratively imagine both 
positive and negative future scenarios of memes after monetization by 
technologies. The speculation activities proceeded for two rounds to explore 
possibilities in different directions. The data included notes of individual 
speculation and group speculation, which were visualized and used in the 
interactive documentary. 
PARTICIPANTS RECRUITMENT 
In this project, an E-mail recruitment strategy was utilized, targeting 
community organizations in North America dedicated to research studies on 
meme creation, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, along with individual 
meme creators and academic writers on social media. The selection of 
organizations was recommended by research networks of AI, Blockchain and 
Digital Futures in OCAD and the individual researchers and creators are those 
who posted articles on Medium. Upon choosing the organizations, meme 
creators and individual researchers, I sent them an E-mail containing the 
recruitment material and a hyperlink to the participant interest form and 
consent form (see Appendix A and B). 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
WORKSHOPS 
The participatory speculative workshop invited participants to become co-
creators and co-constructors of the speculative future of meme-creator 
ownership. It was conducted twice through the Zoom video conferencing 
platform and a Miro board, as these were the best ways to foster collaboration 
given the constraints imposed by geographic location and the convenience 
of the participants. The participants were informed that they could be 
assured of their anonymity. Both workshops involved a focus group 
discussion with four participants, followed by a group speculation activity 
facilitated through a fractal role-playing game called Microscope Explorer. 
Figure 10. Documentation of Workshop Activities 
73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The focus group discussion aimed to generate diverse perspectives and 
insights from professional experts on the topic of interest. Participants were 
asked to reflect on four questions (see Appendix D) related to the workshop 
topic and record their thoughts on stickers provided in the designated work 
area on Miro. This activity was intended to evoke individual reflection and 
generate initial ideas that will be discussed in turn during the group 
discussion. Each participant had five minutes to express their ideas and 
thoughts, shaping potential futures influenced by AI and Blockchain 
technology. They drew on their professional background and insights to 
respond to the proposed questions and contribute valuable insights and 
perspective to the discussion. 
The game-based approach provided an engaging and interactive activity for 
participants to collaboratively build a timeline that envisioned possible 
directions and scenarios related to the future of meme creators' ownership. 
Microscope Explorer is a world-building storytelling game that allows players 
to create a shared history of a fictional world. The initial setting of the game 
includes Big Picture and Bookends. Big Picture refers to the overall theme or 
concept of the game world that players create through their collaboration, in 
this case, it was the landscape that AI generation and Blockchain/NFT 
influence the meme creators' ownership in future. Bookends specify the two 
different directions that go towards a bright and dark future under the big 
74 
 
 
 
picture. Within the initial setting, the game is broken down into three main 
components: Periods, Events, and Scenes. Periods represent broad spans of 
time and are defined by a single player to establish a starting point for the 
game. Events are pivotal moments or turning points that occur within the 
chosen period and are established through collaborative discussion among 
the players. Scenes, on the other hand, are snapshots of specific moments 
within an event and are played out through role-playing and improvisation. 
The game-based setting encouraged participants to think more creatively 
and explore bolder, unexpected ideas. By taking on roles and improvising 
within the context of the game, they were able to step outside of their usual 
perspectives and tap into imaginative solutions, making the workshop results 
more diverse and comprehensive. Also, the game components made the 
process more engaging and relaxed for the participants, maintaining their 
interest and motivation throughout the activity. As a result, they inspired 
each other in the speculation and contributed more actively, leading to a 
more dynamic and productive conversation.The workshop enabled the 
participants to collectively envision and co-create possible futures, providing 
valuable insights and perspectives for further exploration and analysis. The 
data collected was used later as a part of the interactive documentary in the 
thesis project.

Two separate workshops were conducted to facilitate discussions with 
participants from different backgrounds. This approach aimed to promote a 
wide range of ideas and perspectives on the influence of AI and Blockchain 
technology in shaping potential futures. 
In the first workshop, participants primarily had backgrounds in media 
studies and philosophy. Their unique perspectives focused on the ethical, 
societal, and cultural implications of AI and Blockchain technologies. The 
discussions revolved around topics such as the role of disruptive technologies 
in shaping public opinion, addressing privacy concerns, fostering responsible 
innovation, and exploring their impact on the human experience. The second 
workshop featured a more diverse group of participants, including meme 
76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
creators, NFT artists, and AI machine learning experts. These participants 
brought a different set of thoughts and experiences, focusing on the practical 
applications, challenges, and opportunities presented by AI and Blockchain 
technologies. Discussions in this group touched upon topics such as the 
democratization of meme creation through NFTs, the role of AI-generated 
content in the digital landscape, and the potential impact of decentralized 
systems on creators and industries. 
DATA COLLECTION 
Data collection was divided into three categories. The first category was the 
collection of information regarding the professional backgrounds of the 
participants. This information could provide insights into the diversity of the 
group and help to track the contributions made by individual participants 
during the focus group discussion. The second category involved the audio-
recorded dialogue that occurred during the focus group discussion. The 
dialogue, which involved the participants remixing diverse information from 
their varied professional backgrounds, serves as an informative source of 
qualitative data for gaining insights into their opinions, experiences, and 
perspectives. The third category referred to the timeline created during the 
group speculation game, which can be utilized to track the progression of 
ideas and concepts throughout the game. This timeline represented a 
77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
valuable source of information for analysis and interpretation. By categorizing 
the data collection into these three categories, I ensured the comprehensive 
capture of a wide range of data, which served as additional references for the 
visual elements I created in the documentary video as part of my thesis 
deliverables. 
DATA ANALYSIS 
With the intent of analyzing the literature review and workshop data, I used a 
thematic analysis inspired by Braun and Clarke(2019), who define a theme as " 
a pattern found within data that is important to the research question and is 
associated with some level of meaning" (p. 14) in qualitative data analysis. 
They further explain that a theme is not simply a topic or a code, but a 
patterned response or meaning within the data that captures something 
important about the participants' experiences or views. The theme may be 
present in some or all of the data and may be identified “at the manifest level 
(directly observable information) or at the latent level (underlying the 
phenomenon)” (Botyzis, 1998, p.4).

CHAPTER 4: VOYAGE TO THE EDGE OF 
IMAGINATION 
STUDY FINDINGS 
This section takes up the descriptive results of individual speculation through 
historical analysis and group speculation through the Participatory 
Workshops to analyze the ways the thesis project answers my primary and 
secondary research questions. With the intent of bringing the study findings 
from the literature review and Participatory Workshop into critical narratives 
of interactive documentaries, this section is divided into two parts for 
discussion. 
INDIVIDUAL SPECULATION 
The analysis of the literature review resulted in three distinctive themes 
regarding the potential impact of disruptive technologies on the 
monetization of memes that may affect creators. 
The first theme highlights the change of values incorporated in the memes. 
By taking a deep look into the case study of the /b/ board of 4chan, we can 
identify that the relationship between cultural capital and Internet memes is 
intertwined with the creative process and social dynamics that characterize 
79 
 
 
 
 
 
the circulation of memes on social media platforms. Being proficient in 
"meme literacy" has implications for an individual's user status and 
membership within their online communities. In this context, one's capacity 
to create, appreciate, and circulate memes indicates their level of cultural 
competence and membership within the online community. In addition, the 
Meme Economy satirizes the stock market by treating internet memes as 
tradable digital assets. This manifests a concept that revolves around the idea 
of investing in and trading internet memes as if they were stocks in a real-
world market. 
This echoes the Blockchain and NFT that replicates real-world economics and 
assigns economic value to memes by establishing a novel value system that 
offers meme creators the possibility of recognition and compensation by 
trading memes. NFT meme prices reflect how the reliance on community 
and the highlight of virality in memes favor meme creators who have greater 
social capital within the community or those who have popular memes. The 
transfer of cultural, economic, and social capital happens in a pyramidal 
fashion through reflexive feedback loops that mutually reinforce each other. 
Although culture occupies a prominent position at the apex of this structure, 
social currency and economics also exert a significant bottom-up influence, 
yielding tangible consequences in the real world. Within the realm of culture, 
80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
economic and social capital are closely intertwined, occupying a relatively 
equivalent and compelling footing. 
The second theme underscores the potential for AI algorithms, AI meme 
generators and NFT to disrupt conventional models of meme monetization. 
Operating in the attention economy, social media platforms utilize a variety 
of techniques to capture and hold the attention of users. Consequently, this 
new paradigm redefines economic principles, shifting emphasis toward the 
exchange of attention. In this framework, the capacity to attract attention is 
the decisive factor that distinguishes successful influencers and creators from 
less successful ones. As attention is a valuable resource that can be 
monetized through advertising revenue, Internet memes represent a new 
form of approach for marketing, advertising, and branding purposes, since 
they engender a broad and engaged audience who consume, appreciate, 
and potentially modify them. Apart from the algorithms of social media 
platforms, the emergence of AI-generated memes also poses challenges for 
human creators seeking to monetize their work. The escalating prevalence of 
AI-generated memes could saturate the market, making it more difficult for 
human creators to stand out and achieve attention for their work on social 
media platforms. 
81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Machine learning enables AI generators to produce memes in a quick and 
low-cost manner, and has historically made it challenging for human creators 
to compete with the efficiency and affordability of AI meme generation. 
Additionally, AI-generated memes disrupt various fundamental assumptions 
of copyright law in terms of creativity, commercialization, and distribution. It 
is still unclear in most cases who has the right to monetize AI-generated 
memes and whether human creators can claim ownership over them. 
The emergence of meme coins also represents a significant change in the 
economic model of memes under the influence of Blockchain technology. 
Prior to the advent of Blockchain technology, traditional financial systems 
were centralized, with intermediaries such as banks, clearinghouses, and 
regulatory agencies controlling the flow of transactions. The introduction of 
Blockchain technology and decentralized cryptocurrencies like meme coin 
has challenged this paradigm by enabling peer-to-peer transactions without 
the need for intermediaries. This created a new economic model that is 
characterized by decentralization, transparency, and enhanced security. 
Moreover, the use of NFT in transactions ensures that each transaction is 
verified and recorded on an immutable ledger, increasing the trustworthiness 
of the system. Consequently, the rise of Blockchain technology has disrupted 
the traditional economic model and led to the development of a new 
decentralized economic system. 
82 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The third theme emphasizes how meme creators have transitioned to adapt 
to the changing technological landscape for maintaining relevance and 
profitability. The algorithms used on platforms like YouTube and Instagram 
are designed to prioritize content that has higher engagement rates and 
longer watch times. This implies that meme creators who consistently 
produce popular content and have a larger follower base are more likely to 
have their content shown to a wider audience, which in turn enhances their 
visibility, engagement, and revenue. By shaping a hierarchy among creators, 
where those with higher engagement rates and larger followings have an 
advantage over those who do not. Creators respond to this hierarchy in a 
number of ways, such as by using engagement-boosting tactics like clickbait 
titles, creating memes referencing trending topics that resonate with the 
audience and gaining popularity through producing political or commercial 
memes. Some influencers may also invest in advertising or sponsorships to 
increase their reach and visibility on the platform. 
In contrast to the hierarchical algorithms used on other social media 
platforms such as YouTube and Instagram, the algorithm utilized on TikTok is 
characterized by its decentralized nature and the provision of greater 
opportunities for creative content. The algorithm incorporates a range of 
user-specific factors, such as viewing history, search history, and engagement 
83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patterns, to recommend content that is more likely to be of interest to the 
individual user. This stands opposite to the prioritization of professional or 
popular creators, as seen in other social media platforms. Consequently, even 
new or lesser popular creators have the potential to attain a broader audience 
if their content is engaging and resonates with the TikTok community. The 
algorithm used on TikTok also promotes diversity and creativity by promoting 
a range of content and creators, rather than just prioritizing the most popular 
or mainstream content. This holds the promise of fostering unique and 
authentic creative content to achieve traction and visibility, thereby 
potentially leveling the playing field and providing new prospects for 
emerging creators. 
The data analysis reveals a timeline of the intertwining of technological 
change and economic model change in the evolution of memes. This 
timeline is reflected in the emergence of new types of meme creators who 
adapt to changing technological landscapes for being seen in the attention 
economy era. The elements within the timeline will be visualized as part of an 
interactive documentary in the following section. 
84 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 12. Interactive Timeline Wireframe 
GROUP SPECULATION 
The focus group discussion guided subsequent speculation, providing 
direction for the discourse that followed. The first step was to find the initial 
codes, which consisted of individual words, phrases, or short segments of text 
frequently mentioned by participants throughout the discussion. After 
reading the entire transcript and systematically reviewing the specific quotes 
and keywords of the focus group discussion, I assigned interpretive labels 
regarding the conversation's content as initial codes that represented 
important segments. The codes were organized into a codebook, which 
guided further analysis. The initial codes included "meme culture," 
"communication tool," "digital platforms," "monetization," "nature of meme 
85 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
community," "meme ownership," "AI algorithms," "AI meme generation," 
"freedom of creativity," "Blockchain," "NFT memes," and "The Future," based 
on participants' different professional backgrounds and their contribution to 
the topic. 
Next, I organized the initial codes into more specific categories of themes 
based on the relationships between the initial codes and the overarching 
speculative future scenarios imagined through the game. After grouping the 
initial codes with the events and scenes from the game, categories emerged, 
including "the impact of AI algorithms on meme monetization," "the potential 
of AI meme generation in mimicking human meme creation," "the role of 
Blockchain and NFTs in securing creator ownership," "the role of Blockchain 
and NFTs in constructing meme community," and "the new community of 
meme creators in the future." 
The final step involved selecting the most relevant categories and themes to 
create a cohesive narrative that addressed the research question. I reviewed 
the categories and themes to identify the most salient points that emerged 
from the data. The following are the main themes that emerged from the 
analysis. 
86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 13. Initial Codes, Specific Categories and Themes 
Theme 1 - Exploring the Future of Meme Creation, Ownership and Ethics in 
the Future AI and Blockchain Era, combines the impact of AI meme 
generation on human meme creation and the role of Blockchain and NFTs in 
securing creator ownership for speculation. It illustrates a future where 
meme creation becomes utilitarian, and memes enter the perspective of AI 
training and iteration. Artists use AI to create memes, and Blockchain 
technologies are used to differentiate meme creators. Memes, through AI 
iteration, can generate unexpected links that humans did not anticipate, and 
human creators can articulate meaning to them, pushing the boundaries of 
meme production. The use of Blockchain can mark the creation process, and 
purchasing NFTs can become a way to pay for memes, countering business 
exploitation. 
87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The other direction of the future manifests how AI meme generation triggers 
a debate about AI replacing human meme creators. Cooperate giants may 
monopolize meme usage rights through patent laws, and AI-generated 
memes can become propaganda tools after being processed by algorithmic 
black boxes. People who use memes become followers of AI generators, 
leading to human alienation. They also use NFTs to force people who use 
memes to pay fees, which ultimately results in the fading away of “free” 
memes. This darker future emerged as a concern from participants for the 
future rather than speculation based on the solid reality. 
Theme 2- Reclaiming Meme Ownership: Creativity, Identity and Community in 
the Future AI and Blockchain Era, combines the impact of AI algorithms on 
meme monetization and the role of Blockchain and NFTs in constructing a 
meme community. It constructs a future where we will be witnessing a 
counterattack towards AI algorithms by meme artists who strive for originality 
and innovation. Through the establishment of new communities with 
Blockchain technology as their identity, these creators are pushing back 
against AI algorithms and the growing crisis of human identity. By marking 
their social identity with NFTs and utilizing memes as a form of self-expression, 
individuals are able to convey their unique identities outwardly. In turn, meme 
consumers continue to demonstrate support for their preferred NFTs, creating 
88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
a market that sustains this ecosystem of identity expression. Besides, open 
communication and collaboration between meme creators and AI developers 
allows for mutual understanding and the creation of innovative and ethical 
solutions for the use of AI in creative practice. AI becomes a better assistant 
and a source of inspiration. Iterative Machine learning enables AI to recognize 
AI-generated content, therefore human and AI can cooperate at a higher level 
in meme creation. 
Another avenue for imagination depicts the commercialization of meme 
creation that threatens its original intentions of pursuing freedom and 
authenticity in creation. In this case, the original goals of the counterattack by 
meme artists against AI creativity have been compromised. The counterattack 
has, in effect, become AI's own material, thereby blunting the force of the initial 
initiative. Such development has also led to conflicts within the community 
and society. Besides, the utilization of Blockchain technology as a means of 
identification may ultimately result in a symbolic hierarchy of certification. This, 
in turn, could contribute to further identity-based conflicts between those who 
do and do not identify with Blockchain. 
The analysis of the Participatory Speculation and the methodological findings 
of the future of meme creators' ownership derived from this research are 
89 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
summarized to be a part of the thesis output. This will be elaborated in the 
following sections. 
THESIS OUTPUT 
This section describes the creation of the interactive documentary prototype, 
built with an open-source codebase tool.  It plays with the interaction of 
elements including an index named Timeline Jumping, a timeline called 
Meme Creator Timeline, and animation galleries entitled Collective Futures, 
in regard to the topic. The techno-economic development of meme 
monetization history and the participatory speculated future of meme 
creators' ownership are presented in two different ways. The former will be 
presented through a temporal narrative. It guides viewers to the 
chronological stages covering the historical trajectory of technological 
breakthroughs and economic innovation that affect the creation and 
propagation of memes. 
The future is exhibited within an exploratory timeline that allows them to 
discover their own narrative paths within interactive data visualizations of the 
documentary. The framework consists of an interactive guide index on the 
left corner of the project, where blocks with texts introducing the different 
90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
stages of technological breakthroughs alternate with ones displaying various 
changes in all the prominent economic models of meme monetization. The 
project can be viewed as an interactive interface that visually translates 
textual data extracted from the literature review and speculative workshop, 
and presents it to the public as also a database narrative documentary. 
Figure 14. Illustrate diagram of interactive documentary 
TIMELINE JUMPING 
Timeline Jumping functions as an interactive guide index to navigate the 
viewers. Besides the possibility of watching the first part of the documentary 
in its standard sequence by scrolling the page horizontally and vertically, it is 
worth noting the persistent presence of an index on the left corner of the 
91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
project. This feature effectively orients the viewers to their position in the 
narrative and facilitates navigation through the sections. Time is distributed 
radially, while the time span related to the different chapters is shown by 
highlighting icons. By clicking the blocks in the index, the viewers will be 
directed to a specific time point in the timeline corresponding to that block. 
Leveraging the skill of coding through CSS, I created the basic function of the 
interactive guide index, incorporating this function as one of the prominent 
features of the interactive documentary to explore unseen stories within the 
process of meme monetization. Having this in-built interaction mechanism to 
indicate the start of exploration, viewers can more freely choose to investigate 
through the index or continue to seek different stages in the timeline without 
having to navigate through the challenges and confusion that often appear 
when people face an overload of new information. 
MEME CREATOR TIMELINE 
The Meme Creator Timeline uses Historical Analysis to analyze the value 
addition in memes through the meme monetization process that has been 
influenced and changed by disruptive technologies. The prototype of the 
timeline creates space that draws viewers into a journey to explore the 
92 
 
 
 
  
 
 
technological and economic influence of meme creators' ownership with the 
flow of time. 
To create a timeline that showcases the evolution of technological change in 
social media and the corresponding changes in the economic model of 
meme commodification, a thorough historical analysis of the development of 
these two domains was conducted. By examining the historical data and 
trends, it is feasible to identify essential components that have contributed to 
the evolution of these two domains. These components are later utilized to 
create a visual representation incorporated into the timeline. The timeline not 
only illustrates the chronological progression of technological change on 
social media but also highlights the corresponding changes in the meme 
economy. This analytical approach enables the identification of the key 
drivers of change and innovation.

Figure 16. Visualization of the economic models 
I first created a wireframe on Figma to illustrate the complex interplay 
between technology and the economy in the context of social media and 
meme monetization, and how the influences stemming from two distinct 
aspects have shaped the different types of meme creators across varying 
temporal epochs. I created graphical representations of different elements 
that are shown in the timeline. It also invites the viewer to focus on a specific 
time point, as well as to compare themes and continents. Clicking on the dots 
close to the time point brings up pop-ups that show how the selected 
components have affected meme creators' ownership, providing a 
perspective from the past and the present. The timeline enhances 
understanding of the meme creator's circumstances behind the intertwined 
information it displays.

COLLECTIVE FUTURES 
The final piece of work in this project was to create four animation videos that 
visualize the future of meme creators' ownership, as imagined in the 
participatory speculative workshop. The animations incorporate different 
themes that integrate various topics related to the technological impact of AI 
and Blockchain technologies. My creative process entails a blend of 
imagination, research, and technical skills. For the future part of the 
interactive documentary, my objective was to produce an animated, meme-
style motion graphic that examines the conjectural prospects of meme 
creators' ownership. 
97 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Two components shaping the animations’ vernacular are the camera zooms 
and the motion comic style. I initially conducted research on the impact of 
technological advancements and the evolution of economic models on 
meme culture. Following that, I used an AI meme generator to identify an 
appropriate meme format as the foundation for my creation. After selecting a 
template, I traced all the meme images to ensure that they did not infringe 
on any original works. In addition, I made some remixes and combinations of 
multiple memes to create new and unique content. This step was crucial in 
ensuring that my work was original and not a copy of someone else's 
creation. By creating new content, I could also convey the complex concepts 
related to the future of meme ownership in a creative and engaging way. 
Once the tracing and remixing were complete, I proceeded to animate in the 
consideration of incorporating various themes that emerged during the 
workshop discussions and activities. My intention was to depict and 
communicate intricate concepts related to the future of meme ownership in 
a clear and captivating manner.

99 
 
 
 
 
 
To foster engagement and interaction, I create a branching narrative where 
the viewer is presented with a choice of two paths, each leading to a different 
future. Viewers can use this form to explore two divergent scenarios that 
represent the potential prospect. I provide the viewer with options at the 
beginning of the vision of the future, allowing them to choose which path 
they want to follow. Each path has its own set of animations and interactive 
elements that showcase the unique outcomes of that future. By experiencing 
both paths, the viewer can gain a deeper understanding of the importance of 
being aware of the innovative force and the potential impact AI and 
Blockchain technologies could have on creative individuals and practitioners. 
Therefore, every movement and click in this project is meaningful. This format 
relatively provides a great deal of interactivity and freedom to users while the 
creator can have control over what the audience views by cautiously 
selecting the content to keep the audience from an information tsunami.

CHAPTER 5: CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
SUMMARY OF THE RESEARCH 
The primary research question that underpins this project is: How might 
technological changes on social media platforms impact a creator’s 
ownership of memes? 
To develop a comprehensive understanding of the functionality and benefits 
of possible futures of meme creators' ownership, a literature review was 
conducted to examine the historical evolution of memes affected by 
technological advancement and the history of meme monetization that 
reflected the change in the valuation of the meme. This review continued 
with an exploration of copyright and authorship of both human and AI-
created memes, focusing on how Blockchain technologies provide fractional 
solutions to the ownership issue while AI generation challenges the current 
legal framework of copyright. To envision the future scenarios of meme 
creators, Economic Constructivism was applied to identify the prominent 
issues embedded in the present that affect the future, from an individual 
perspective. This phase was followed by Participatory Speculation to invite 
experts from relevant fields to join the discussion, incorporating diverse 
102 
 
 
 
 
  
perspectives and collectively envisioning potential futures, and eventually 
present the results of the research in the form of an interactive documentary. 
This research reveals that disruptive technologies, specifically Blockchain 
technologies and AI algorithms, hold the potential to provide novel 
opportunities for creators of internet memes to gain compensation for their 
creativity by selling their memes. Nevertheless, it is essential to note that 
disruptive technologies also introduce fresh challenges that necessitate a 
judicious approach for wise navigation. Originally, the creation and diffusion 
of meme culture was a collaborative process that featured the participatory 
culture, far from a competitive and economically motivated practice. While 
Blockchain-based platforms may offer avenues for creators to directly sell 
their memes to consumers and establish ownership of their intellectual 
property through tokens, the use of AI algorithms for more targeted 
advertising and sponsorships may increase competition and contribute to 
market saturation. Creators can leverage the technology's ability to mimic 
human creativity, produce original work, and generate diverse content. These 
AI systems, equipped with attributes such as creativity, autonomy, and 
learning capabilities, can generate creative art, potentially blurring ownership 
and copyright lines. As AI-generated works grow more prevalent, creators 
must navigate the complexities of copyright laws and legal frameworks. AI 
systems can be viewed as creative employees or independent contractors, 
103 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
attributing ownership and responsibility to individuals or legal entities 
utilizing these systems. This approach acknowledges the creative 
contributions of AI while recognizing the distinct creativity of human authors. 
AI-generated work typically involves gathering training data and producing 
intermediary iterations for refining algorithms. However, AI advancements 
like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can create images without 
intermediary steps, posing new challenges for human creators. As AI's 
sophistication increases and its output becomes more similar to human-
authored works, creators must adapt to accommodate AI authorship within 
the existing copyright framework. As these disruptive technologies continue 
to evolve and become increasingly integrated into meme creation, creators 
must remain vigilant in identifying and capitalizing on new opportunities 
while addressing potential challenges. 
REFLECTION ON METHODOLOGIES AND METHODS 
Economic Constructivism was initially chosen as a methodology for this 
research due to its successful application in the early stages of exploration of 
the topic, echoing the approach taken in the literature review section that 
examines the history of meme monetization, the shifting values of memes 
affected by the technological change, and the impact of AI and NFTs on the 
ownership rights of meme creators. The significance of forming the basis for 
104 
 
 
 
 
 
understanding the technological impact on the creation and distribution of 
memes surfaced predominantly as a catalyst for later discussions in the 
participatory process. The analysis was presented as a background context to 
generate a set of insightful questions (See Appendix D) for the discussion 
among experts from diverse professional fields who attended the 
participatory. This played a crucial role in locating the intersection of 
technology, economy and creativity for the focus group discussion for 
participants, sparking the thoughts and ideas of experts from various 
professional backgrounds. 
Participatory Speculation as a methodology was valuable in bringing 
together diverse perspectives and fostering interdisciplinary discussions that 
can enrich the understanding of complex topics. Through the focus group 
discussion, these experts shared their unique perspectives and knowledge in 
their own professional field to compose a more comprehensive 
understanding of the varied components affecting the future of meme 
creators. The gamification of the workshop played a crucial role in enhancing 
the content and perspective of the study. It fosters a more relaxed and 
creative collaborative environment, enabling participants to express their 
ideas more freely and sparkling a collection of new insights and ideas that 
may not have emerged through focus group discussion. The game-based 
approach within the workshop ideation was an appropriate method to 
105 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
complement the speculative process, encompassing stages of conception to 
co-creation of possible futures. It offered value in collaborative imagination 
and ideation, where the open-ended nature and focus on scenario-building 
facilitated the generation of diverse and unpredictable ideas. These features 
of collaborative imagination were also reflected in the final creation of 
animation in the interactive documentary. 
REFLECTION ON THE THESIS PROJECT 
TIMELINE JUMPING 
Timeline Jumping provides an interactive and engaging experience for 
viewers, allowing them to navigate through the content in a non-linear way. 
The use of an interactive index serves as an effective guide, providing viewers 
with a clear understanding of their position in the narrative and allowing for 
effortless navigation through the different sections. The horizontal 
distribution of technological and economic evolution as well as the 
highlighting of time spans in different stages further facilitate user’s 
exploration. 
106 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To enhance the viewer's experience, the inclusion of supplementary visual 
cues or interactive components to signal the precise location of the viewer 
within the timeline could be advantageous. This may encompass the 
utilization of color variations, animations, or auditory effects to draw attention 
to specific time points. Additionally, the integration of more detailed 
descriptions or summaries for each segment could aid in contextualizing and 
illuminating the significance of the events being depicted. 
In terms of the manifestation of information, the interactive guide index is a 
particularly effective feature, allowing viewers to easily explore the different 
stages in the timeline and discover unseen stories within the process of 
meme monetization. However, it may be helpful to consider incorporating 
more detailed information or context within each section, such as quotes 
from experts or statistics to provide additional insight and support for the 
narrative being presented. 
MEME CREATOR TIMELINE 
Meme Creator Timeline is a project that utilizes historical analysis, seeking to 
unravel the intricate evolution of memes and their monetization processes. 
Through an engaging and thoughtfully designed timeline, the project 
107 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enables viewers to explore the complex interplay between technology and 
the economy, particularly in the context of social media and meme 
monetization. By leveraging a meticulous historical analysis, the project 
identifies essential components that have driven change and innovation in 
these two domains, thereby offering a compelling perspective on the 
evolution of meme creators and their economic value. 
To enhance the viewer's experience, it may be helpful to incorporate 
additional visual elements that guide the viewer's focus and attention, such 
as changes in color or motion graphics, to display the happening change in 
specific points of the timeline. Additionally, incorporating interactive 
elements, such as clickable pop-ups or videos, may help to provide more 
detailed information or context for each section, and further enhance the 
viewer's understanding of the interconnected dynamics between technology 
and the economy in the context of social media and meme monetization. 
In terms of the clear clarification of information, the timeline showcases the 
evolution of technological change in social media and the corresponding 
changes in the economic model of meme commodification, highlighting the 
key drivers of change and innovation. However, it may be helpful to 
incorporate more detailed information or data to support the narrative being 
presented, such as expert quotes or statistical analyses, to provide deeper 
108 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
insight and context for the viewer. Overall, the Meme Creator Timeline 
effectively illustrates the complex and interconnected nature of meme 
monetization and change of meme creators, and has great potential for 
further development and improvement. 
COLLECTIVE FUTURES 
Collective Futures involves the creation of four animation videos that explore 
the future of meme creators' ownership. It is an undertaking that requires a 
delicate balance of creativity, research, and technical skills. The use of 
animation and branching narratives adds an interactive and engaging 
dimension to the documentary, making it more fun to watch and interact 
with. 
To further enhance the elements of interactivity and engagement, several 
improvements could be made to the project. For instance, by incorporating 
social elements such as user-generated content, live chats, and forums. This 
would allow viewers to connect with each other and share their thoughts and 
ideas, making the experience more collaborative and community-driven.

SIGNIFICANCE AND FUTURE WORK 
The significance of this study lies in its contribution to the ongoing discourse 
on the future of creative ownership and monetization of digital artifacts in the 
digital era, particularly in the context of memes, which represents the 
freedom and creativity of human beings. The proposed vision of the future of 
meme creators' ownership and the interactive documentary created as part 
of this study may serve as a catalyst for further research and discussions 
among scholars, creators, and policymakers on the legal, ethical, and 
economic implications of technological disruptions on creative ownership 
and value. Future work could explore the implications of the findings on value 
change in digital artifacts, techno-economic influence, industry practices, and 
creator’s awareness, as well as the potential of interdisciplinary collaborations 
in shaping the future of creative ownership and value in the digital age. 
Future work related to this research will also focus on exploring the legal, 
ethical, and economic implications of the proposed vision of the future 
regarding meme creators' ownership and the potential role of AI algorithms 
and Blockchain technologies in reshaping creative ownership and value. This 
future work will contribute to a community of scholars, creators, 
policymakers, and industry practitioners interested in the ongoing discourse 
on the future of creative ownership and monetization in the digital era. The 
findings of this research and the proposed vision of the future will serve as a 
110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
starting point for further discussions and debates on the potential of 
emerging technologies to disrupt traditional models of creative ownership 
and value, as well as the need for legal and ethical frameworks that reflect 
these changes. 
Additionally, this work could contribute to a community of interdisciplinary 
researchers and practitioners interested in the intersections of technology, 
economy and creativity. The study's use of Participatory Speculation and 
collaborative methodologies could serve as a model for future research that 
seeks to engage diverse perspectives and expertise in imagining and shaping 
the future of creative industries. 
CONCLUSION 
This project aimed to explore the impact of technological change on the 
creation and propagation of memes in contemporary digital culture and 
envisions a possible future for the meme creator’s ownership. It responded to 
the primary research question, investigating how technological changes on 
social media platforms impact a creator’s ownership of memes in the 
attention economy. This research can be conceptualized as examining the 
topic in two distinct directions. By identifying how the technological 
evolution influence the creation and propagation of memes on the digital 
111 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
platforms, and how the AI algorithms change the way creators and 
consumers determine the value of memes, I propose that the AI algorithms 
present new opportunities to catalyze human creativity for meme creators 
and to think of what creators should do to avoid homogenization of creativity. 
By examining how Blockchain and NFT replicates real-world economics and 
assigns economic value to memes by establishing a novel value system, I 
discover that its disruption offers meme creators the possibility of recognition 
and compensation by trading memes. I believe that the Blockchain 
technologies will open up possibilities for emerging communities where 
meme creators can reshape ownership of collective creation with NFTs and 
the decentralized nature will liberate the meme creators from the constraint 
of algorithms and bring out prospects of creativity. 
The key contributions of this project include the Participatory Speculation 
that invites experts to collaboratively imagine the future landscape of meme 
creators' ownership together. The process has contributed to my 
understanding of the secondary research question, with the highlight of the 
participatory workshop as an effective tool for speculative thinking with the 
collaborative space for individuals to share ideas and and inspire each other. 
The interactive documentary also responds to the secondary research 
question, manifesting positive promise as a project to present the co-create 
112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
possible futures of meme creators' ownership, with its clear clarification of 
information on technological and economic change, interactive and 
engaging experience, and freedom to explore new content via different paths 
of navigation. With further enhancements to the elements of interactivity and 
visual appeal, it could be even more playful in inviting and captivating the 
audience as part of an interactive documentary.
