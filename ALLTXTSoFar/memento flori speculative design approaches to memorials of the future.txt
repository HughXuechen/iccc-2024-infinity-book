Abstract 
Through a speculative design approach, we explore the 
benefits and drawbacks of virtual memorials. This work is 
presented within the context of a fictional business, 
Memento Flori, which offers users digital and tangible 
solutions to preserving their identity in the future. To 
illustrate a potential future where memorials are routinely 
held in immersive spaces, we produced digital artifacts, 
including a business website and product designs. Inspired 
by a generational timeline made possible when families 
routinely upload memories to a virtual environment, these 
designs include a memory capsule, in the form of a DNA-
based projector, as an exploration into tangible 
representations of memories. 
This work explores ideas about how technology will evolve 
to support passing on generational information over time, 
with the aim to initiate a conversation around what parts of 
an identity can be preserved after someone’s passing, and 
what form memories can take on for different individuals.

Dedication 
To my family, who continuously inspire me to 
work hard and pursue my goals, especially my sisters 
Martina and Laura, who kept my inbox full of jokes 
and reminded me to enjoy the process. 
Thank you to my supervisor, Prof. Steve 
DiPaola, who believed in this idea and encouraged 
me to push it even further than I thought possible. 
Your support was invaluable and shaped my 
graduate school experience to be an exciting and 
interesting journey. 
Thanks also to committee member Prof. 
Carman Neustaedter, who offered valuable 
perspective and helpful feedback along the way.

The virtual memorial design portion of this work was 
done as a five-person group project completed in 
the School of Interactive Arts and Technology as 
part of my supervisor Prof. Steve DiPaola’s IAT848 
Mixed Reality Design course. Thanks to the group 
members, Chelsea Mills, Maryam Zarei, Ayaskant 
Panigrahi, and Katrien Jacobs, for their effort in 
developing the initial framework of Memento Flori 
as a final class project. For that class project, I was 
responsible for all visual and concept design work 
on the team, as well as a part of collaborative 
brainstorming sessions. My responsibilities included 
the website concept and design, visual concept 
sketches, and storyboards for all the video work. 
The final class project for IAT848 was completed in 
April 2021. One year later, in talking with Prof. 
DiPaola, given the deep questions that arose from 
the work, we decided to expand upon that initial 
conceptual work as a separate full thesis research 
project, including alternative design avenues for 
future memorials. Some of the materials and 
underlying concepts from the class project are used 
and expanded on in part of this thesis work, for 
which the roles of each team member are defined 
in detail on the respective project chapter pages.

Chapter 1. 
Introduction 
During the Covid 19 pandemic, most in-
person contact was restricted, resulting in many 
families having to say goodbye to their loved ones 
through a screen [1]. Though communication across 
distance has become commonplace, voice and 
video calls lack the personal touch needed for 
emotional events involving grief. Based on funeral 
rituals across cultures, and current online memorials, 
we aim to design future memorial experiences that 
incorporate interactive technologies This 
speculative design project explores three different 
approaches and their potential to provide for a deep 
and meaningful memorial experience in the future: 
•
Immersive environments
•
DNA collection
•
AI image generation
Our overall goal is to address the challenge of 
maintaining the human factor in a digital 
environment, and to explore ways in which personal 
memories can be preserved over a long period of 
time. To do so, we created and developed three 
speculative visual designs, to illustrate a potential 
future of how technology will shape memorials. 
3 
Immersive Environments 
Virtual environments offer opportunities for 
social connection through group interaction, unique 
movement such as teleporting or shrinking and 
immersive visuals which surround a user. Many 
online memorials are two-dimensional and involve 
one-way interactions, such as posting a message or 
adding a picture  [2]–[4]. Even in 3D virtual spaces, 
most current designs resort to a gallery layout with a 
flat, two- dimensional presentation [5] The impactful 
visuals in virtual reality have been shown to reduce 
feelings of isolation [6]. 
Curating an environment which can be 
emotionally supportive is vital to a memorial setting. 
Making better use of the three-dimensional aspect 
of virtual reality could result in a more meaningful 
memorial experience.  
Tangible Keepsakes 
Looking back on cherished memories is a way 
to process grief after a loss. Video and image files 
can be saved and shown repeatedly for generations. 
While some technologies, such as VCRs or DVDs 
may become obsolete, converting and transferring 
4 
older files into new formats is possible. These files 
can be an authentic visual and auditory 
representation of a person. However, video and 
image files can be manipulated and altered. To 
explore the possibilities of how memories can be 
passed down for many generations, we 
speculatively illustrate a possible future in which 
essential qualities of a person can be preserved as a 
keepsake. 
The recently popular DNA testing kits that 
users order to discover more about their heritage 
and potential health risks have made DNA testing of 
the general public a common practice [7]–[9]. To 
secure an authentic representation of a loved one, 
we envision a future where  DNA can be used to 
create a personal keepsake. 
Emotive Artificial Intelligence 
Artificial intelligence is currently being used 
for text and image generation [10]–[12]. Users have 
an active role in the creation process, choosing 
visual styles and keywords to enter into the system. 
AI is currently able to create realistic portraits as well 
as abstract artwork, but it requires many modifiers 
and specific keyword input to generate the intended 
image [13]. By creating visuals from user input, the 
5 
connection between the viewer and the images 
becomes personal and can be customized to 
viewers’ needs. This direct interaction can lead to a 
sense of ownership toward the end result. Assuming 
the growth of AI’s capability due to increased use, 
and the amount of personal data available online, AI 
could potentially be a driving force in creating 
emotionally representative visuals of individuals. 
1.1. 
Methodology 
This work falls within the field of Human-
Computer Interaction (HCI). Methodologies such as 
cultural probes or user studies on the topics of death 
and dying carry the risk of emotional or mental 
harm, if done insensitively. Most current work in this 
field has remained within the subjects of cultural 
theory and artistic practice, to allow space for 
personal introspection and to mitigate potential risks 
involved when carrying out research studies of this 
nature [14]. The goal of creation in the HCI space on 
the topic of death has often been based on personal 
insight, rather than confronting users with a 
concept, with the goal of receiving feedback for 
analysis. Keeping this in mind, this work takes an 
6 
introspective, graphic design approach within the 
speculative design space. 
Speculative Design 
Given current advances in technology, we 
can make assumptions about the future of 
interactive technologies and how humans will 
interact with immersive and interactive 
environments. Design fiction offers the opportunity 
to explore hypothetical design questions without 
technical restraints to illustrate future technologies 
[15]–[18]. Speculative design is an interdisciplinary 
design methodology that can involve product 
design, user experience design, and visual design, 
among other disciplines [15], [16]. The wide range of 
possibilities in this area of study leads to 
interdisciplinary approaches in creating the artifacts 
[18]. Among other disciplines, current speculative 
designs have applied “techniques borrowed from 
film, literature, ecology, comedy and psychology to 
develop and present plausible futures” [15]. 
Auger [15] developed an overview of possible 
”alternative presents” versus “speculative futures”. 
Alternative presents refer to previous technologies 
iterated past their existing states. Speculative futures 
7 
refers to designs created through imagined 
development of an emerging technology [15]. Our 
work sits on the right side of the design spectrum, in 
the area of imagined “speculative futures” (Figure 1). 
Figure 1. Auger’s [15] 
alternative presents 
and speculative 
futures diagram. 
The aim of speculative futures is to provoke 
thought and discussion about the ethical and social 
implications of the imagined products [16]. Auger 
[15] describes the following strategies to present
design fiction:
8 
•
Define the context of the artifact
•
Define the functionalities of the proposed artifact
•
Design a visual or tangible prototype to illustrate the
use of the artifact
In the next section, we describe three 
research goals to apply these strategies to specific 
designs. 
1.2. 
Research Goals 
This work is a speculative design project 
based in visual design, created to explore potential 
memorial services of the future. Following Auger’s 
[15] strategies, we designed digital artifacts to
represent a future of memorials that involve
technological development past current
mainstream use. These artifacts were designed
within the context of a fictitious business which
offers immersive memorial experiences in the
future. Memento Flori owns an immersive
environment, built by users to curate spaces to
remember their loved one by.
With this work, we contribute digital artifacts 
in the form of a website, design guidelines for virtual 
memorials, an interactive memory preserver design 
concept, and AI- generated artwork illustrating a 
9 
progression of life, to showcase potential memorials 
of the future and to spark discussion about the 
ethical implications of preserving the life of a loved 
one in a digital space. The fundamental goal we 
aimed to achieve with this work was to propose 
memorial designs using interactive technologies in 
the future. To do so, we narrowed down three 
research goals to create design proposals for. 
Goal 1.  
Creating a meaningful and respectful memorial 
experience in an immersive virtual environment 
Through brainstorming, iterative design 
sessions, and a comparison of existing memorial 
websites, we considered the types of memorial 
businesses that would be successful in the future. 
Current virtual environments allow for a lot of social 
and interface interactions, however there is little 
consideration for handling virtual content after a 
user's death [14]. The first project is a business 
concept design showcasing memorial services in 
virtual reality (VR). The concept is presented in the 
form of a business website, showing an overview 
and the service offerings. By creating this website, 
we collected insights into a list of suggested 
guidelines for virtual memorial environments and 
10 
highlight the harsh reality that even with infinite 
cyberspace, death is still a profitable endeavor. 
Goal 2.  
Preserving Memories for Future Generations 
To explore the possibility of a tangible 
representation of a loved one, I designed a product 
as a part of the Memento Flori suite of products. 
Based on popular DNA testing kits, and memorial 
sites that financially support genetic testing, offering 
users a way to preserve their memories in their own 
home is a plausible next step. 
This second project is a speculative design 
concept for an interactive system that illustrates a 
person’s memories. These memories can be saved 
during life, or they can be given from loved ones 
after a person passes away. This product design is a 
memory preserver that converts DNA into an 
artwork of memories, in a modular design to allow 
for connecting with family members. The system 
relies on personal input as well as input from loved 
ones, resulting in a blend of self- perceived as well as 
an external view from positively connected people. 
In the end, the visuals are personalized and 
respectfully representative of the individual. When 
11 
someone passes away, the memories collected 
throughout life, and shaped by personal 
relationships, can be watched back to reflect on a 
person’s life. This product design was created 
through a combination of graphic design and AI-
generated art. 
Goal 3.  
Creating Emotionally Meaningful and  
Personally Representative AI-generated Art 
Using AI as an ideation tool, we illustrated the 
possibility of visualizing memories using an AI art 
agent. As interest in AI portraits has become 
increasingly popular employing an AI agent to 
create animations to preserve memories over long 
periods of time could be a future possibility [11], [13], 
[13], [19].  
Applying a lifespan-oriented approach, I 
generated images using an AI model to portray 
various stages of life [20]. After creating an overview 
of what an AI-generated lifespan could look like, I 
took a more personal approach and used an AI 
model to portray memories of a family member.  In 
creating these images, a personal artistic practice 
can lend insight to how new technologies could 
12 
evolve to be in a supportive role during 
bereavement. 
1.3. 
Background 
To determine the factors that figure into 
fostering a comforting and emotionally meaningful 
environment, this section examines differences in 
funeral rituals and customs due to cultural and 
religious influences. 
Cultural Differences in Funeral Rituals 
Grieving the loss of a loved one is a nuanced 
emotional process. Differences in culture and 
religion shape an individual’s belief in an afterlife, and 
as a result determine how they engage in rituals to 
honor a loved one’s memory [21]–[28]. Social 
Anthropologist Mary Douglas described rituals as a 
way for humans to “purify things that are out of 
place” [29]. Rituals are integral to the grieving 
process to acknowledge and honor, socially and 
physically, someone who has passed away [21], [23]. 
In addition to cultural background and religious 
beliefs, the timing, duration, and intensity of these 
memorial rituals can vary based on individual family 
traditions [21], [23], [24]. 
13 
Local societal influences shape our view of 
humanity, placing priority on either autonomy or 
community [30]–[36]. Individualist cultures 
encourage independence and self-sufficiency, with 
young adults living alone and establishing their own 
routines [31], [32]. People in individualistic cultures 
are driven by their personal values rather than group 
norms [32], [33]. Collectivist cultures are 
community-oriented, encouraging multi-
generational living in a single space for as long as 
possible [31], [33]. In collectivist cultures, people tend 
to act in consideration of group norms within their 
community [30]. Grief is expressed differently 
depending on whether a culture is individualistic or 
collectivist [32], [35], [36]. Catlin [27] investigated 
bereavement in the USA as an individualistic culture 
and Spain as a collectivist culture, finding that after 
the passing of a loved one, feelings of liking and trust 
in others were positively affected in Spain, while 
liking and trust in others were negatively affected in 
the United States. Both groups experienced a 
negative effect on self-esteem [27]. After 
experiencing death of a loved one, individualistic 
cultures seem to pull away, as shown by the 
heightened distrust in others, while collectivist 
cultures seem to seek out social connection in times 
14 
of grief. Collectivist cultures have higher rates of 
attention to eldercare, demonstrating greater 
involvement with their aging family members [37]. 
When speculating on future memorial 
practices, and which designs could support them, 
we aim to meet culture-based user needs by 
creating designs that would appeal to both 
individualistic as well as collectivist cultures. Offering 
the opportunity to choose how to socially engage 
will create meaningful interactions for a wide range 
of users. Any environments or personal devices that 
support memorial practices should be open to 
individual use for private introspective interactions, 
as well as interactions that create avenues for 
communication and connection within a group. 
Religious Practices in Funeral Rituals 
Bereavement rituals also differ based on 
religion. In pre-Hispanic cultures in Mesoamerica, life 
and death were viewed as a whole, complete life 
process, rather than opposite concepts [38]. Current 
Latin American death rituals are described as having 
strong Catholic influences, including the belief that 
the soul lives on in an afterlife, and that there can be 
a continued relationship through prayer and altar 
15
 
offerings [38]. There are two celebrations centered 
around death: Novenas and El Dia de los Muertos 
[38], [39]. Novenas is a Christian prayer ritual which 
was derived from the Roman practice, novendial, 
which is a nine- day period of mourning and prayer 
following a death [39]. El Dia de los Muertos is a day 
to remember loved ones who have passed away, by 
cleaning and decorating altars, and placing food 
offerings dedicated to them. Common offerings 
such as marigolds, candles, sugar skulls, fresh water, 
and sweet bread are placed on the altar around 
photos of the deceased. The food is meant to 
sustain the souls on their journey in the afterlife, 
while lit candles symbolize enlightenment and the 
beginning of a new spiritual life [39], [40]. 
In China, Japan, and Korea, the philosophies 
of Confucianism and Buddhism influence 
bereavement rituals. Funerals and post-funeral 
ceremonies are important rites of passage. Dignity 
and harmony are highly valued in these belief 
systems and must be upheld during the memorial to 
ensure safe passage into the afterlife [41]–[43]. Other 
Buddhist rituals in Tibet involve celestial burials [44]. 
During a celestial burial, the remains of the 
deceased are left out in the open at a high level of 
16
 
elevation to decompose naturally. The location is 
meant to encourage vultures to process the body 
and carry it into the heavens [44]. China observes a 
day of ancestral worship, Qingming [43]. Tombs are 
cleaned, and food, drinks, and money are left as 
offerings. Families will fly kites and send lanterns into 
the sky to honor their ancestors [43], [45]. Japan also 
celebrates a day honoring ancestors, the Obon 
festival [42]. The celebration stems from belief in 
ancestral spirits, as well as the Buddhist custom of 
honoring ancestors in the afterlife [42], [45]. During 
the Obon festival, celebrants hang lanterns and offer 
food and drink to their ancestors. Belief in Karma, 
mostly associated with Buddhist and Hindu religions, 
is closely tied to adherents' belief in life after death 
and reincarnation [45]–[47]; a person’s behavior on 
earth will determine whether they are admitted into 
the realm of the divine or whether they are reborn 
until they achieve a selfless life [46]. In Hindu funeral 
services, death is seen as a final transformation, to 
be reunited with a higher power [98, 171]. In India, 
families pay homage to ancestors during Pitru 
Paksha, a 16- day period of celebration, a joyous 
event involving group gatherings and food offerings 
[47], [48]. Countries with Hindu culture often hold 
17
 
cremation rituals, for example, Murkhangi in India, 
and Ngaben in Bali, Indonesia [21], [47], [49], [50]. It 
is thought that the soul is tethered to the body until 
it is cremated, so the cremation ceremony takes 
place shortly after death, following a funeral 
ceremony at the home [47], [51]. The body is 
anointed and surrounded with flowers, wrapped in a 
white sheet, and then cremated. There is a 
mourning period of about 10-13 days following the 
cremation, which is concluded with a Shraddha 
ceremony [51]. The Shraddha is meant to help the 
deceased transition into the next stage and includes 
prayers and offerings of food. On the yearly 
anniversary of the death, there is another Shraddha 
ceremony to welcome the deceased to the group 
of ancestors [46], [47], [51], [52]. 
African death rituals differ based on the 
different religious groups on the African continent. 
Across most of Africa, death is seen as a transition 
rather than a loss, and it is believed that deceased 
people have an influence over the living [25], [45], 
[53]–[55]. The Ga ethnic group from Ghana sculpts 
coffins and decorates them in bright colors to 
represent the occupation or favorite pastime of the 
person who passed away (Figures 2, 3, 4) [53], [56], 
[57]. Honoring the dead is vital to ensuring good 
18
 
favor throughout life. In Madagascar, there is a 
celebration of the dead, Famadihana, meaning 
“turning of the bones”, during which graves are 
uncovered and burial shrouds are replaced by fresh 
ones [55], [58]. The ceremony is a happy moment for 
the family to bond and reminisce about their 
ancestors and introduce them to any new family 
members [58]. Similar rituals are seen in Indonesia, 
where the Toraja people uncover mummified 
relatives to change their clothes and adorn them 
with jewelry [59], [60]. The ritual, “ma’nene,” 
meaning care of ancestors, takes place after the rice 
harvest. Death is viewed as a transitory period, and 
until the burial ritual, the dead are “to’makula,” sick, 
not dead [59], [61]. Though Hinduism is seen in many 
parts of Indonesia, the Toraja people don’t adhere to 
the Hindu custom of cremation. Only “sinners” are 
cremated, and do not receive a funeral ceremony 
which would allow their soul to transition into the 
afterlife [59]–[61].

“In Ghana, chiefs are often 
transported via palaquins (also known as 
sedan chairs) during traditional festivals. In 
the 1950s, Seth Kane Kwei, a young carpenter, 
made a palaquin in the shape of a cocoa pod 
for one such chief. Unfortunately, the chief died 
unexpectedly before the festival, so he was 
buried in the palanquin instead. At his funeral, 
the unique coffin drew many admirers.”

In the Islamic faith, death is seen as a resting 
of the spirit until judgment day [62]. Belief of an 
afterlife is dependent on whether the soul is good or 
bad, which is determined by Allah. Islamic funeral 
rituals involve collective bathing of the body, 
enshrouding in a white cloth, a prayer, and a burial in 
a position so that the head of the deceased is facing 
Mecca [45], [63], [64]. Widows observe an extended 
mourning period of four months and ten days, while 
relatives observe a three-day mourning period [62], 
[63]. 
Jewish funerals are similar in ceremony, 
however cremation and embalming are disfavored, 
so that the body can decompose naturally [65]. The 
funeral takes place shortly after death, to ensure a 
quick transition into the afterlife [65], [66]. Christian 
funeral rituals involve a prayer ceremony, usually 
held at a church or at the cemetery [67]. After the 
lowering of the body, loved ones take soil and 
scatter it over the coffin. There is no prescribed 
mourning period. The deceased are believed to live 
in perpetuity in either the paradise of heaven, or the 
agony of hell, depending on how they conducted 
themselves on earth. Though cremation is not 
prohibited, burials are preferred, due to Christian’s 
21
 
belief in resurrection [22], [45], [67]. In New Orleans, 
there is a unique funeral style involving music. A jazz 
band leads a procession to the memorial service, 
playing somber music. After the memorial, the band 
plays lively, upbeat tunes to celebrate a life well lived 
[68], [69]. The sadness of grief and the appreciation 
of life are both captured in this ritual, ending on a 
positive note [69]. 
For those without religious affiliation, 
humanist funerals often involve burial or cremation, 
considering the individual’s choice. Services are held 
for a sense of closure for the living, rather than a 
transition for the deceased [22], [70]. Without the 
expectation of an afterlife, the content of a memorial 
tends to shift towards shared memories, and what a 
person has achieved in their life. Milestones in career 
or family life are presented and the service is 
focused on past moments [66], [70]–[72]. Overall, a 
study of atheist funeral practices showed that 
celebratory funerals are preferred, including the 
sharing of fond memories to cope with grief [70]. 
While some hold somber memorials, other 
cultures dance and celebrate a life well-lived [45], 
[66]. A belief in an afterlife stems anxiety around 
death through the feeling of hope [22], [25], [26], 
22 
[28]. If there is an expectation of a rich afterlife, or 
reincarnation, the funerals will reflect the faith that 
the deceased is now continuing their life in a 
different form. These memorials often take on a 
hopeful tone, looking toward the potential future 
their loved ones are experiencing in the afterlife [22], 
[25], [45], [71]. In both religious and non-religious, 
collectivist and individualist cultures, there is 
common ground. In reviewing bereavement rituals 
and their origin, universal overlap can be found in 
the areas of physical offerings and social events to 
commemorate a loved one [23], [32], [45], [61] .  
Common themes across all funeral services 
involve leaving offerings, mainly placing lit candles or 
flowers, at a headstone or altar [23], [66]. Engaging 
in physical practices, such as leaving gifts and food 
on an altar or decorating gravesites with flowers and 
photos, shows a tangible representation of a 
personal connection to the deceased [24], [25], [27]. 
Another universal aspect seen in most religious 
practices is a social gathering to commemorate a 
loved one, whether it is a public event or a more 
intimate event for close family members. Coming 
together as a group enables emotional support, and 
reaching out for reassurance becomes easier. 
23
 
Speaking about shared experiences strengthens the 
memory of a loved one and allows family members 
to bond while reminiscing [25], [45]. The universal 
overlap seen in most religious practices suggests 
the need for group gatherings, tangible mementos, 
and offerings in the form of food or flowers, as 
features in future memorials. Therefore, our 
proposals include designs that are conducive to 
group events as well as preserving mementos over 
long periods of time for future generations. 
Death and Dying in HCI 
With concerns around privacy and creating a 
meaningful representation of a loved one who 
passed away, there is a need for a secure and 
customizable options for memorials in digital spaces 
[73]. Many users resort to holding virtual funerals in 
gaming environments or leaving comments on 
social media accounts of deceased users to process 
grief online [74]–[76]. The reappropriation of these 
virtual environments suggests users’ need for a 
virtual space specifically designed with death in 
mind [77]. Massimi and Charise [77] encouraged a 
humanist approach, specifically the application of 
thanatosensitivity, in the research and development 
24
 
of interactive technological systems. The concept of 
thanatosensitivity refers to the awareness of death 
and dying in HCI, so that issues such as finite data 
storage, data access after death, or data handling 
according to an individual’s wishes, are approached 
as a necessary design consideration rather than an 
afterthought [77], [78]. Current approaches to 
thanatosensitive design have focused primarily on 
the bereaved rather than the dying [79]. Considering 
the experience of dying as a moment to design for, 
instead of placing focus on the bereaved, was 
broken down into categories, described in Albers’ 
overview termed the “tasks of dying”. 
25
 
Figure 5. Albers’ 
overview of various 
states of wellbeing 
during death [79]. 
Applying Massimi and Charise’s [77] 
thanatosensitive HCI design approach to Albers’ 
tasks of dying can give designers a precise avenue in 
their work, i.e. designing functionalities pertaining to 
specific tasks, in an effort to further support 
individuals during and after death. Current work 
regarding end-of-life care is primarily focused on 
physical well-being [80]–[82]. HCI systems can still 
offer more support in the areas of spiritual and 
psychological wellbeing [77], [79]. Specific gaps 
were identified in the areas of balancing a dying 
26 
persons autonomy with their involvement in their 
memorial process, as well as fostering feelings of 
hope and reaffirming sources of spiritual energy 
during end-of-life care [14], [79].  
Massimi et al. [14] suggested future work 
supporting death-centric practices in the areas of: 
•
collaborative acts of remembrance
•
bequeathing of digital data
•
group reflection on the digital residua of a life
These categories support the universal 
overlap found in religious funeral practices (personal 
mementos and group events), and additionally 
encourage “digital residua” as a representation of a 
life – a personal timeline of sorts, based on the digital 
content created over time. The temporal aspect of 
modern digital content creation results in useful 
information for visualizing long-term generational 
stories [83], [84]. Designing a customizable 
environment that allows for personal digital content 
presentation specifically to commemorate a loved 
one during bereavement would give users a 
designated space to process their grief without any 
interference from other social content.

Chapter 2. 
Memorial Design in Immersive 
Spaces 
Virtual spaces have become a way to connect 
people across distances while offering an immersive 
experience. While entertainment and visual arts 
have been among the first industries to find their 
home in the Metaverse, the social aspect of virtual 
environments has led to personal milestones, such 
as birthdays, weddings, and funerals, being held 
online. For an emotionally nuanced event such as a 
funeral, it’s important to find the balance between 
respectful and meaningful. With this project, we 
present Memento Flori, a fictional business offering 
virtual reality memorial services of the future. 
Overall, this work aims to illustrate potential future 
memorial services by developing a concept for an 
immersive memorial business. By creating this 
business concept, we hope to gain insight on what 
design choices are crucial for social events in a 
virtual space, as well as how to preserve the human 
factor in a digital space, especially for a sensitive and 
emotional event like a memorial. 
29
 
2.1. 
Virtual Communication and Events 
Holding large group events online has 
financial and accessibility benefits [85]–[90]. In times 
where travel or in-person events have become 
limited, online meetings with video chats have 
become an everyday occurrence [89], [91], [92]. 
Without the possibility of in-person communication, 
virtual meetings have become a useful tool to 
communicate across all industries, for education, 
work, even social milestones. During the Covid-19 
pandemic, weddings were livestreamed while 
families and friends attended from their own homes 
[1], [91]–[94]. There were also many deaths that had 
to be processed across distance. Family members 
were forced to say goodbye to their loved ones 
through a screen [91], [95]. As people increasingly 
rely on virtual communication for social events, 
interacting with an immersive space for a memorial 
service may not be too far into the future. 
Funerals are an expensive undertaking; many 
people have gone into debt to cover costs [96]–[98]. 
Funeral costs stem largely from the memorial event, 
including the service and location [98]. Holding a 
virtual memorial allows those who would otherwise 
be constrained by time or location to participate in 
30
 
the event, while saving money on travel and event 
funding. With technologies such as video chat 
platforms and virtual reality (VR) spaces developing 
rapidly to bring more communication into digital 
environments, memorial services in fully immersive 
virtual space can be a more interactive alternative to 
two dimensional conversations in front of a screen 
[86], [88], [89]. 
Virtual reality has become a common 
concept in the mainstream. The social technology 
company Facebook staked its claim in the VR 
territory by developing VR headsets [99]. Alongside 
the hardware, they developed an immersive virtual 
world for users to join, the Metaverse. In 2021, the 
company rebranded as “Meta” to demonstrate their 
prioritization of their work in the Metaverse [100]. At 
first, users could only access the virtual world by 
logging in through their Facebook account; in 
response to users’ reluctance to join the Metaverse 
through their personal accounts, Meta created a 
new login system – Meta accounts [101]. In addition 
to their VR real estate, Meta also recently attempted 
to launch their own cryptocurrency, Diem [102]. The 
launch was cancelled, but the thought of a Meta-
controlled cryptocurrency makes joining their virtual 
31
 
space even more daunting. If the launch had been 
successful, it is reasonable to assume users would 
have been financially limited to Meta’s own currency 
if they want to engage in this space, similar to how 
users were limited to Facebook account logins for 
access to the Metaverse. Forcing brand loyalty on 
users to participate in the Metaverse is not desirable 
for privacy reasons; however, offering a central 
virtual space to meet, work, play, and pay, without 
breaking immersion, makes the barrier to entry in a 
virtual world much lower. 
Virtual Reality adds an aspect that a two-
dimensional website cannot fulfil – it can be an 
emotional experience. Being able to reach people on 
an emotional level is crucial to creating a meaningful 
memorial space [89]. Users in immersive 
environments reported feelings of awe and a 
decrease in the feeling of isolation when they were 
viewing content in virtual reality [6], [103], [104]. Not 
all VR experiences are positive; the context and 
details of the content shape the emotional 
experience [86], [104], [105]. From a design 
perspective, the surroundings of the memorial 
environment can be adjusted to create a warm and 
welcoming environment. 
32
 
2.2. 
Security and Privacy in Online 
Memorials 
Memorial websites have been online since 
the late 1990s [3]. Most of these sites are interactive 
on a two- dimensional basis, allowing users to leave 
notes, or an image of a flower or candle, on the page 
they created for their loved ones who have passed 
away [2], [3], [106]–[108]. These memorial websites 
are openly accessible to the public. Users who post 
on these sites may think of them solely as public 
obituaries, but when there is the potential for 
interaction, such as leaving a message on the public 
page, the site becomes vulnerable to misuse. Other 
than a small hurdle of creating an account, most 
memorial websites had no strict requirements to 
identify as a family member or friend affiliated with 
the memorial page [2], [3], [107]. For these webpage-
based memorials, an added layer of protection 
through password-protected access or verifying the 
identities of the users signing on may be sufficient to 
keep misuse to a minimum. There are memorial 
websites, such as “inmemori”, which use an access 
link that families can distribute to trusted friends 
[106]. However, once you expand the online 
memorial environment to three dimensional spaces, 
33
 
such as virtual gaming, the parameters become 
more complicated. 
Through online communities, users can play 
games and strategize together in real time, often 
forming strong social bonds [109]. With the ability to 
meet and connect online, players may not know 
each other in person, or live near one another. If a 
gamer dies, the online community can come 
together online to mourn the loss of their friend, 
despite physical distance. Though this is a solution 
for connecting across distance, there are risks in 
holding a memorial event in an online, publicly 
accessible space. In 2006, a funeral was held in the 
game World of Warcraft, to honor a player who had 
passed away [74], [76]. The memorial invitations 
were sent to the players guild, but they were sent as 
public invitations. A rival guild came across these 
invitations, and organized a raid on the funeral, killing 
off players as they attended. The funeral was meant 
to be filmed and sent to the player’s family as a 
memory of their respected activity in the gaming 
community [74]. A memorial in an environment that 
was beloved to the player is a meaningful way to 
honor their memory, but the environment should be 
34
 
kept separate from game mechanics (in this case, 
battle) to remain respectful. 
2.2.1. 
Privacy in Virtual Reality Environments 
Privacy and safety in virtual environments 
have been topics of discussion since the dawn of VR. 
Health aspects, such as eye strain or cybersickness, 
as well as social aspects, such as isolation, or explicit 
game content, have been questioned by VR critics 
[73], [81], [89], [110]. Eyestrain and cybersickness are 
physical reactions that limit users’ time in VR [111]. 
These issues may be reduced as technology 
improves, but in some instances, there is not much 
possibility for improvement, such as if a user is prone 
to nausea when wearing a headset. While single-
player video games may lead to social isolation, 
many interactions in VR can be beneficial to social 
lives and are conducive to positive social 
connections [89], [104], [109]. With the possibility of 
social interaction, the safety concerns in virtual 
environments shift towards the quality and type of 
social interactions users are having. Schroeder [112] 
describes different perceptions of users in VR, 
including a feeling of presence and co-presence. 
Presence refers to a user’s state of mind, whether 
35
 
they feel grounded and actively engaged when in a 
virtual environment. Immersive environments that 
are designed with six degrees of freedom1 in mind, 
easily convey cues that help users feel present in the 
space [113]. This is demonstrated by effects on user’s 
balance, and loss of physical spatial awareness when 
in VR [112]. Co-presence refers to the awareness that 
users are around and available to socialize [85]. 
Whether that availability be broadcasted publicly is 
often left up to the user. Users can enter private 
spaces or engage with certain VR environments in 
an anonymous way, thus limiting interaction such as 
chat features or group activities. The social 
experience also depends on group dynamics – small 
or large groups call for different experiences for 
optimal social interaction [131]. For a user to feel 
secure enough to engage in an interaction, with the 
environment or with another user, group dynamics 
must be considered [85]. 
A sense of security and privacy are important 
to creating a harmonious online event [105], [111]. The 
anonymity of the internet has created a platform for  
1 Six degrees of freedom refers to the ability to move across multiple 
directional planes in VR along the X, Y, and Z axis. 
36
 
people to speak their mind without 
consequences. This kind of unfiltered discourse 
leads to users continuously pushing boundaries, 
which can result in a hostile environment online. The 
safety of users in a memorial space is of utmost 
importance, to ensure that the grieving process 
does not get derailed by any worries of insecurity or 
strangers participating in an event that does not 
pertain to them. 
Including safety measures, such as adding 
loved ones to a group of trusted profiles ahead of 
time, would stem any unwanted input from flooding 
the space. Curating a list of trusted individuals is 
already a feature of social media site, Facebook [75]. 
Facebook users can select trusted profiles to 
manage their account if it gets compromised, for 
example if a user loses a password or gets hacked. 
Trusted profiles can also be added to manage an 
account when a user dies. After death, user profiles 
can be permanently deleted or become “legacy 
accounts” [114]. Legacy profiles allow connected 
users to see photos and videos, as well as post 
messages or media to the account. No birthday 
reminders or suggestions to “add as a friend” are 
available for legacy accounts, on the assumption 
37
 
that regular reminders may retrigger the grieving 
process. However, sharing legacy accounts with 
connected friends may help them come together 
during bereavement. Allowing an avenue for social 
connection even after a profile owner has passed 
could offer solace during a difficult time. 
Accordingly, user safety must be considered 
a top priority in the design of Memento Flori. Feeling 
safe in a virtual environment is crucial to creating a 
meaningful experience. Once safety measures are in 
place, they need to be shared with the user, so 
expectations of possible interactions are clear. For 
example, a user may not feel comfortable sharing 
their sentiments in a memorial setting if they only 
see a group of stylized avatars. Safety measures 
should be implemented in a way such that social 
connection and support are not undermined. If 
anonymous users prefer to grieve in private, the 
virtual environment should be able to pick up the 
slack by offering interaction options separate from 
the group setting. 
2.2.2. 
Digital Memorials Meet Physical DNA 
When DNA and memorial websites mix, 
sensitive personal information is added to the 
38
 
persona that is your digital identity. For example, the 
memorial websites Weremember, and Find a Grave 
are owned by Ancestry, the DNA testing business that 
traces back genes and family trees for decades [2], 
[3], [8]. Marketed as a self-discovery experience, 
companies like Ancestry and 23&me sell the idea of 
finding out a personal origin and history, with the 
added benefit of reporting whether a genetic 
disposition to certain illnesses is present [8], [9]. The 
medical aspect is helpful, but it comes at the cost of 
personal medical data being available to companies 
that have no stake in users’ individual safety. Many 
people have opted into these services. As of 2019, 26 
million people have sent in their DNA, making it 
possible for users to see a network of family members 
appear on their accounts [7]. 
Evaluating user behavior patterns has become 
increasingly easy since the development of social 
media sites [115]. People have been volunteering their 
personal likes and dislikes, career information, age, 
birthdate, death date, online obituaries, as well as 
medical information from DNA samples. Connecting 
to this web of information online has made it possible 
to predict a person’s behavior. An authentic voice can 
39
 
2.3. 
be added to a digital persona from a person’s digital 
footprint. Messages and writing styles can easily be 
recreated through artificial intelligence (AI) systems 
[115]. Online messages from social media apps, such 
as Facebook messenger, Instagram, or WhatsApp, 
and E-mails, can be compiled and analyzed by AI 
systems which can then produce language that is 
indistinguishable from the original writer. 
Companies such as Replika have built a business 
around using social media messages and emails to 
create an AI Avatar, so that loved ones can still 
communicate with someone after they have passed 
away [116]. As time goes on, it would be possible to 
curate a person’s voice and personality, developed 
over years, and even splice the content into age 
ranges. In the future, you could potentially speak to 
your mother’s 14-year-old self or have a 
conversation with a great-great-grandparent who 
you never got to meet. 
Immersive Virtual Memorials 
The company “Remember” has developed a 
metaverse memorial in which images and videos are 
minted as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) [5]. It is a 
virtual 3D space which showcases these NFTs in a 
gallery view. A membership gets users a symbolic 
40
 
3D stone, and access to a memorial hall, where 
personal photos and videos can be uploaded. A 
benefit of this view is that it allows users to have an 
entire gallery of their memories presented to them 
online, which may not be feasible in the physical 
world. However, having a three-dimensional gallery 
of two-dimensional media is unnecessary. The value 
of NFTs is significantly higher when the media offers 
an additional experience. For example, if the NFT 
grants access to a concert, as seen with the band 
Kings of Leon, or if it unlocks a membership to a 
community, such as with the Bored Ape Yacht Club 
[117], [118]. Aesthetic visuals alone are not sufficient for 
reliable engagement. More meaningful and long-
lasting interactive experiences can be created by 
adding a relevant communal experience. If users 
have a personal connection to the visuals, a stronger 
interest, and a stronger feeling of responsibility 
towards the environment, can be upheld. 
2.4. 
Designing Memento Flori 
We created a design concept exploring the 
necessities, benefits, and drawbacks of an immersive 
funeral service. To offer context around our design 
proposals, we created the fictional business, 
41
 
Memento Flori, which specializes in virtual 
immersive funeral services. 
Through a collaborative brainstorming 
session and comparing existing memorial websites, 
we developed a list of features necessary for an 
immersive memorial. After grouping features into 
categories, we created three characters to 
showcase selected features from each category. 
Based on these characters and their needs, we 
created three video vignettes, to highlight different 
aspects of Memento Floris business offerings. 
Concept art illustrates the Memento Flori 
environment, to develop a visual language that 
draws users in and makes them feel at ease. 
Through an iterative design process, we narrowed 
down the sketches to the final visual style. With 
these sketches, we created a visual world to 
illustrate the future of interactive memorials in the 
Metaverse. The concept designs presented here 
are iterations on a potential visual outcome, but 
would be open to customization by users to suit 
their unique bereavement needs.

2.4.1. 
Memento Flori’s Business Website 
This immersive memorial business concept is 
portrayed through artifacts: memorial feature 
descriptions, three video vignettes, and a visual 
design. To present these artifacts within the context 
of Memento Floris business, I designed a website to 
hold Memento Flori’s user testimonial videos,

Immersive Memorial Features 
Confronting participants with mortality is 
unethical and could have damaging results. 
Therefore, design as an introspective practice is a 
crucial component of thanatosensitive work. 
However, when only one perspective is involved in 
developing interactive features, they become one-
sided. To gain a wider perspective on the options 
available when designing an immersive space, as 
well as to mitigate any emotional risk, we began a 
collaborative brainstorming session with a group of 
people who previously consented to discussing the 
topic of death and dying. This group consisted of 
HCI researchers in the areas of cognitive science, 
44
 
graphic design, 3D modeling and design, and game 
design. Based on the groups similar background but 
diverse skill set, we were able to discuss varying 
perspectives on the importance of interactive 
features involved in creating a meaningful memorial 
environment. We began by reviewing existing 
memorial sites and marking down similarities and 
components that overlapped, and how they were 
useful for a memorial site. We grouped the functions 
into four categories to agree on the main features 
Memento Flori’s environment should have. The 
categories seen in most current memorial sites 
included: 
•
Communication between users
o
Chat windows between users
o
Leaving messages for loved ones
o
Public Chat threads
•
Group Events
o
Date and Time information for memorial
events [3], [106]
o
Virtual meetings (in pre-existing virtual
environments, repurposed as a memorial
event) [74], [78]
o
Livestreaming a memorial for accessibility
[95]
45
 
•
Media/Visuals representing a loved one
o
Portraits
o
Slideshows
o
Videos
o
List of achievements
Surprisingly, many memorial sites lacked 
safety measures; they were not account-based or 
password-protected [2], [3], [106]. When memorial 
sites are treated as public obituaries, personal 
information ends up being accessible to parties who 
may not have the deceased’s best interest at heart. 
So, we added user safety as a component to design 
for, to contribute options for users to engage in 
emotionally sensitive events online without concern. 
•
Privacy issues:
o
Lacking password-protected entry
o
No account creation, or non-verified
account creation
o
Publicly accessible sites with portraits and
extensive personal information
46
 
brainstorming session, we developed a list of 
features that would be useful for a virtual memorial 
by comparing existing memorial websites and virtual 
worlds. We grouped interactive features in a 
collaborative mind map and eliminated features that 
were not conducive to communication, group 
events, and privacy in a virtual environment. 
Features that overlapped conceptually were 
grouped into a category. In the end, we chose six 
key features to conceptualize. 
Next, we defined specific interactions users 
could have within these categories, in the virtual 
memorial environment. Through a collaborative 
47
 
Figure 7. Sorting and 
summary of interaction 
ideation session, 
February 20th 2021. 
The final interactions were centered around 
communication and preserving keepsakes, to make 
a memorial service possible. The interactions we 
included to be filmed and presented as part of the 
business were: 
48
 
•
Communicate with loved ones who have passed away
Avatars which adopt authentic language 
patterns and mannerisms can be created for 
yourself or for a loved one. Avatars can be 
customized to realistically resemble a person and 
can encompass all their lived experiences by 
cataloguing users’ social media profiles. 
This interaction was inspired by funeral 
practices from the Toraja people’s funeral practice, 
ma’nene, as well as the funeral practice Famadihana 
seen in Madagascar, during which ancestors are 
uncovered and changed into fresh clothing and 
adorned with jewelry to celebrate their life and 
introduce them to new relatives [55], [59], [61], [119]. 
Making ancestors part of present times, even though 
they are no longer among the living, is seen in these 
Indonesian and Madagascan cultures. Within a 
virtual environment, this could manifest as an avatar 
based on a deceased persons digital persona to 
share continued experiences with after their death. 
•
Collect/curate digital artifacts, photos, videos, sound clips
A digital gallery that can be edited and 
curated by designated family members and friends, 
49
 
so visual memories and voices can be captured and 
saved in a central location. 
Adding media is a crucial component of a 
memorial site. Placing photos on altars or posting 
photos on social media after a loved one passes 
away is common practice in most cultures [45], [66]. 
Currently, photographs and videos are the easiest 
way to preserve a memory of a person, and the 
functionality to upload media files is central to 
customizing a memorial site. 
•
Preserve objects, upload in 3D to interact with in VR
3D scanning and uploading objects is a 
resourceful way to hold onto memories without 
taking up physical space. For example, including 3D 
walkthroughs of childhood homes, a favorite mug 
that was used every morning, or uploading favorite 
books from a home library in the memorial space 
lets future generations have a glimpse into family 
members’ life from the past. 
Most online memorial sites rely on a 2D 
gallery view of images, even those created in a 3D 
space [5]. 3D scans of personal objects were shown 
to evoke meaningful storytelling in virtual and 
50
 
augmented environments [120]. Making better use 
of 3D functionality, users should be able to scan and 
upload physical objects to their Memento Flori 
flower, so they can preserve their favorite items in 
3D while saving physical space, in addition to the 
opportunity for meaningful conversations. 
•
Show an overview of relationships, a family tree
This feature is available to preserve 
relationships between family members and friends 
in a virtual space. Entire generations can connect 
their Memento Flori flowers and upload shared 
memories or artifacts which will appear as a network 
of experiences within the garden. 
The family tree network is similar to an 
ofrenda, a Mexican altar depicting images of 
ancestors, along with food, flowers, and candles, 
demonstrates a family history displayed in a singular 
cohesive space for remembrance [39]. By 
connecting family members through their virtual 
flower sites, ancestry can be visualized and followed 
by users. Over time, a large network will continue to 
grow, showing the progression of media and 
artifacts loved ones have preserved.  
51
 
•
Hold a group event
Organizing a meeting point and notifying 
other users is available to trusted family members or 
friends. Designated users can plan an event to hold a 
virtual memorial service. The options for socializing 
include a central public meeting space, as well as 
designated plots for flowers, which users can gather 
around. 
All funeral practices involve a group 
gathering, whether that is shortly after death, or for a 
planned memorial service after the burial rituals 
have been completed [45], [93]. Kirkpatrick [121] 
explored conscious engagement with absence and 
presence in immersive spaces. By giving users 
agency in how they engage with an environment 
when processing personal loss, relationships can 
deepen, especially during co-creation. Offering 
space for gatherings in large groups, as well as 
smaller spaces for intimate gatherings, is a key 
component in creating a meaningful memorial 
space. 
•
A responsive system that helps its users
52
 
Giving users options to interact with the 
environment and each other, and surround 
themselves with memories, is integral to the 
memorial space. However, the system itself can be 
useful in supporting users during bereavement. If 
users opt in, Memento Flori can keep track of login 
dates and times, birthdays or anniversaries, and 
general patterns of activity to react to users’ needs. 
If someone is struggling and visiting more frequently 
than usual, or on important dates, Memento Flori 
would show the option to connect with a mental 
health professional, or it could show which friends 
are available online to chat. 
Collectivist cultures tend to share in their grief 
and reach out to others for support, demonstrating 
levels of trust in others during times of emotional 
need [27], [31], [32]. However, individualist cultures 
tend to isolate, and trust in others was reportedly 
lower during times of grief [27], [31], [32]. Users from 
individualistic backgrounds may not instinctively 
interact with other users for emotional support. 
Taking the first step in communicating is daunting, 
and isolation is likely to prolong feelings of sadness 
or grief [93], [122]. Having a system that can prompt 
communication in a subtle way may be helpful to 
53
 
those who are struggling to reach out, especially if 
the system can connect users with known and 
trusted individuals. 
Filming in a Virtual Environment 
Video Vignettes 
In the VR world, Tivoli Cloud, we designed a 
virtual environment to represent Memento Floris 
immersive memorial space. This virtual world built 
the visual foundation of the user testimonial video 
vignettes. Using the Tivoli environment as a 
backdrop, different scenes were staged and filmed, 
to demonstrate Memento Flori’s features and 
interactions. I created concept sketches and 
interaction storyboards to develop a visual style for 
the virtual environment. (The concept sketches and 
environment ideation can be found in detail in 
section 2.5., Environment Design. Storyboards can 
be found under Appendix A.) The 3D Tivoli world 
build was created by Ayaskant Panigrahi. 
To showcase Memento Floris environment 
features, we created three characters to give 
context to specific interactions. These videos act as 
a commercial mockup for a potential userbase, 
serving as a fictitious testimonial for Memento 
Flori's virtual memorial services.  
54
 
The video vignettes each depict certain 
features that Memento Flori offers. We divided up 
the chosen features into three parts and allocated 
them to a character to represent core features of 
Memento Flori’s memorial options. We 
storyboarded and filmed staged interactions based 
around each user persona’s needs. Each need was 
defined with a specific Memento Flori feature in 
mind. Overall, these vignettes showcase Memento 
Floris key features which support the goal of 
preserving memories across multiple generations. 
The full videos can be viewed on the 
homepage of Memento Flori's business website.

Subscription-based  
Pricing Model 
Blockchain-based payment and storage 
services are currently available as a package deal. 
Currently, companies such as Filecoin combine 
cryptocurrency with multimedia storage [123]. 
Providing an immediate payment option in the same 
realm where users store their artifacts and honor 
their loved ones would allow Memento Flori to 
handle its data as well as its payments on their own 
blockchain. Memento Flori has its own decentralized 
blockchain, which is powered by the token, Lifecoin. 
Cryptocurrency is a requirement for joining the 
space – only payments made in Lifecoin are 
accepted. Once users sign up for Memento Flori’s 
service, they transfer the money and receive the 
Lifecoin token in exchange, to be spent on 
customizing and expanding their memorial space. 
By keeping payments tethered to the Memento Flori 
blockchain, users can pay seamlessly “in-world” 
without breaking immersion or disrupting their 
process.  
With physical funerals, many have gone into 
debt to cover funeral costs [Winter, 2022]. To serve 
a wide range of clients, Memento Flori offers 
62
 
multiple options for maintaining a plot. Given 
current subscription-based models, such as the 
Adobe Creative Suite, for creating and maintaining 
digital work [124], [125]. Memento Flori also employs 
a subscription-based pricing model which offers 
users a hierarchy of choice for their afterlife. 
Prolonged and enhanced interactions are offered on 
a subscription basis. Better features are unlocked at 
the highest price point, while the lowest price option 
includes only basic interactions. The cheapest plan 
allows users to plant a virtual flower and use it as a 
meeting spot to commemorate their loved one who 
passed away. The second- tier plan allows users to 
upload digital artifacts, such as photos or videos, 
which appear when the flower blooms and opens 
(only with permitted access). The most expensive 
allows you to upload a 3D model of a physical 
object. A favorite coffee mug, instrument, or 
childhood home could be uploaded and revisited in 
the metaverse. With any subscription, users can 
additionally purchase an avatar that looks and 
behaves like the person they lost. 
63
 
2.5. 
Environment Design 
Memento Flori is a virtual landscape that 
allows users to rent segments and place a grave site, 
for a loved one, or for yourself, in advance. It is 
visually built as a garden situated in the Metaverse. 
Users can rent a plot of land and plant a virtual 
flower, which acts as the focal point of the grave. 
Multiple flowers can be grouped together to form a 
communal garden, to keep families or friends 
together in the virtual space. 
Memento Flori users have the choice to 
renew every year or subscribe centuries in advance. 
If the subscription expires, the corresponding flower 
is locked and inaccessible, and the caretaker of the 
flower is notified. If payments are not continued, the 
flower, and all attached artifacts and avatars, are 
destroyed to make space for new clients. 
Overall, there are three parts to the Memento 
Flori space. There is the graveyard, which holds the 
entire interactive flower garden, a central courtyard 
for meeting in groups and holding scheduled events, 
and a private garden, where users can go to interact 
with their loved ones’ avatar or artifacts without 
having to socialize or meet any other people (Figure 
64
 
11). The flower garden is at the center of the space, 
where users will find themselves when they first 
enter the Memento Flori space. The communal 
meeting space is to the right and can be booked for 
large group events. To the left, the private area acts 
as a space for limited interaction, where users will be 
shielded from view and their avatars will become 
anonymous. 
Figure 11. Memento 
Flori Map Overview. 
65
 
Offering privacy was a crucial part of the 
design. Having a designated space for users to 
grieve without social interruptions affords the 
privacy that a live funeral cannot, as well as added 
protection from unwanted messages that can occur 
on an openly accessible memorial website. Letting 
users uphold a boundary and choose the level of 
privacy they need sets Memento Flori apart from 
other online memorial formats such as Findagrave, 
Inmemori, or Weremember [2], [3], [106], due to its 
shielded privacy area in which users are not visible 
to others for social interaction. Users can decide 
whether they would like a scheduled event, with a 
detailed timing, or a designated spot to plant an 
interactive flower, which loved ones can visit 
asynchronously. For a planned event, users are able 
to book the stage, with an amphitheater for a large 
gathering. Events can also be held directly at a 
memorial flower. 
2.5.1. 
Visual Style 
Through an iterative design process, we 
created a variety of sketches to illustrate the 
environment. Through these sketches, we explored 
different color palettes, shapes, and compositions. 
66
 
To make a digital space in VR feel more grounded, 
natural elements, such as virtual flowers, can be 
incorporated, as well as adding low lighting or 
fluorescent effects to emulate candlelight. 
The initial sketches depicted sharp edges and 
strong lines. Warm tones and a light color palette 
were incorporated to portray a welcoming 
environment (Figure 12, 13). Though this style is 
future-focused and can be easily implemented in a 
digital space, it does not lend itself to the immersive 
and comforting feeling we wanted to evoke in a 
memorial space. The second iteration included 
softer lines, and rounder shapes, in order to stay true 
to the organic forms found in nature. Carrying 
organic forms over into a digital environment blends 
the physical and digital world in a softer way, giving 
users the sense of being immersed in a garden 
rather than a technological space (Figures 14, 15). 
For the visual language, we chose a calming, 
dark blue environment to emulate the feeling of an 
outer space atmosphere. The garden is lined by 
fluorescent flowers. If users are permitted access, 
they will see a path light up, leading them to the 
flower they want to visit. (Figures 16, 17, 18).

These sketches represent some 
potential styles a user could apply 
to their Memento Flori environment. 
Whether they opt for a classic flower 
shape, or a tree with hanging media 
elements, the arrangement, 
coloring, and layout is dependent 
on a users personal needs.

2.5.2. 
Interacting in Memento Flori’s Virtual 
Environment 
The environment and interactive features 
available in Memento Flori were explored in a series 
of storyboard sketches, to imagine a walkthrough of 
the memorial process (Figure 19). Users are guided 
through the space and, depending on permissions, 
they will see all the interactive sites available to 
them. 
An interactive flower acts as a signifier of the 
person who passed away; it can be customized in 
style and shape to visually represent them. The 
flowers are placed in the garden area, which is open 
to the public. However, only designated family and 
friends are allowed access. Memento Flori is not a 
public obituary. Virtual funerals have been raided 
and sensitive personal information has been publicly 
available online, as seen on previous memorial sites 
[3], [74], [106]. To create a space that allows users to 
feel comfortable in adding their personal 
information and artifacts, a layer of protection must 
be upheld. In knowing that only trusted family 
members and friends will be able to interact with or 
customize the flower, users will feel a sense of 
security and be more willing to create a truly 
71
 
Interacting with  
the Flower 
personal space. If users have been given permission, 
once they enter Memento Flori’s space, they will see 
a path light up that will lead them to the flower. 
Once they reach the flower, it will open to reveal the 
interaction options available to them. 
The flower can be customized to represent a 
loved one. Trusted family members or friends can be 
given access to curate an interactive flower for 
someone who has passed away. Interaction options 
are separated into two modes: edit mode or viewing 
mode. 
Edit Mode 
Edit mode is reserved for trusted family 
members who have been chosen to create and 
uphold the flower. Edit mode includes: 
•
Choosing the flower’s visual style
•
Color
•
Petal shape
•
Size
72
 
•
Adding media artifacts
•
Image
•
Video
•
Audio Clips
•
Adding a 3D object (i.e., a 3D scan of a home)
•
Creating and refining an avatar
•
Scheduling events
•
Reserving a virtual location
•
Sending invitations to loved ones
Viewing Mode 
If someone wants to pay their respects and 
visit a flower, viewing options include: 
•
Viewing media artifacts
•
Holding, viewing, or using 3D objects
•
Attending memorial events, with an invitation
•
Interacting with the Avatar

Privacy 
As a viewer, if a user is not comfortable with a 
group setting or if they are not interested in 
interacting with other users who may be at the 
flower at the same time, they can remove a petal 
from the flower. This creates a virtual shield around 
them, and they enter private mode. They can walk 
around the Memento Flori environment, but they 
will not see or be seen by any other users while they 
are walking with the petal (Figure 19). By holding 
onto a virtual object from a memento flower, a user 
can take a piece of their loved one with them as they 
walk around the environment. Having a physical or 
visual representation of a loved one during grief is 
seen across all cultures, whether this takes the form 
of photos, heirlooms, or memorabilia, in a way to 
continue a relationship with their loved ones after 
death [21]. For users who want to share a private 
moment with the memory of their loved one, for 
example, an individualistic user who is not open to 
socializing, carrying a petal as a symbolic 
representation of the flower will strengthen the 
feeling of connection to the person who passed 
away. At the same time, allowing users to walk away 
from the crowd that may be at the flower, while 
76
 
keeping the benefits of viewing artifacts by using the 
petal instead, creates a flexible functionality that can 
appeal to both group-oriented users as well as 
primarily introspective users.   
Memento Flori  
DNA kits 
To fully integrate a user into the Memento 
Flori Metaverse, users can order a Memento Flori 
DNA kit (Figure 21). Health information and family 
connections will be analyzed and represented within 
the garden as a connected web of flower pods. 
Users will have to consent to Memento Flori 
handling their DNA to see their family tree. The more 
users opt in, the more intricate and personal the 
family tree can become (Figure 22). 
Generational Connections 
As users continue to curate their space in 
Memento Flori, they can connect to loved ones and 
ensure their memories will be joined for eternity. 
Over multiple family connections and relationships 
will develop to form a network of memories. Visitors 
can go back in time and see their ancestor’s digitally 
preserved keepsakes and get immersed in a 
different time (Figure 22).

An Empathetic  
Environment 
Through a responsive system that recognizes 
a user's needs, the interaction in the environment is 
tailored towards an individual’s current state. If users 
opt in, Memento Flori turns on eye gaze and facial 
expression analysis. By monitoring a user's focus, the 
system can determine whether a user is actively 
engaging with specific artifacts, and what effect the 
interaction is having on their emotional state. By 
tracking login durations and intervals, as well as 
important dates such as anniversaries or birthdates 
of the deceased, the environment can tell whether a 
user is returning more often around certain times, or 
if they need assistance in planning a social event to 
commemorate their loved one. If a user appears to 
be struggling emotionally, the environment reacts to 
a user's behavior by offering options to contact a 
mental health professional or any online friends 
(Figure 23)

2.6. 
Summary 
Designing a virtual environment allows for 
physically defying features, such as shrinking or 
flying, making it a unique option for group events, 
with the additional benefit of not taking up physical 
space. Virtual memorials can make use of these 
benefits, such as consolidating digital artifacts and 
80
 
facilitating social interactions across distance. With 
this project, we present Memento Floris website, 
illustrating the potential services that could be 
offered for immersive virtual funerals in the future. 
This work explores the idea of future memorials 
involving interactive technologies. Bringing 
Massimi’s concept of thanatosensitivity to the design 
process leads to designers working with the 
concept of death as a starting point. When groups 
consent to discussing death and dying beforehand, 
further inquiry into the space can happen safely, 
with recognition of the potential risks involved. 
Before the collaborative brainstorming session to 
develop Memento Floris key features, all group 
members were aware of the topic, including the 
knowledge that they could take on other tasks or 
remove themselves from the meeting if they started 
to struggle mentally or emotionally.   
Based on design exploration of a metaverse 
memorial concept, as well as globally overlapping 
cultural rituals and needs, we find the following criteria 
to be crucial to a meaningful memorial experience. 
The virtual memorial needs to:  
81
 
•
be respectful
•
be appropriate/representative of the deceased be
open for collaborative engagement
•
offer a space for privacy
•
have protection and a security barrier to protect
from misuse
•
be visually engaging
Memorials are expensive and moving them
online would save money compared to a physical 
event. A benefit of a digitally immersive funeral is 
accessibility, for those who cannot physically attend 
due to distance or health constraints. However, the 
immersive space will offer new opportunities, 
hypothetically life- like avatars, or online object-
preserving, making digitally immersive funerals 
potentially more costly than “real life” funerals, at 
least until the novelty wears off. Memento Flori has a 
pricing model, only payable in a Memento Flori-
owned cryptocurrency, which gives users a 
hierarchy of choice for their afterlife. Video vignettes 
of fictional users tell a story about how certain 
features may be beneficial in the future. These 
vignettes are ad videos meant to draw in customers, 
so they are purely positive and act as marketing 
material for the platform. This overly perfect 
representation of Memento Flori’s Memorial 
82
 
Services is a stark contrast to the pricing page, 
which reduces death to a number. No matter how 
effective the technology is at protecting a user's 
privacy, and offering an authentic representation of 
a loved one, it is reasonable to assume that 
Memento Flori will continue the practice of 
subscription-based services to maximize profits. To 
be in complete control of their ecosystem, they keep 
payments on a Memento Flori-owned blockchain 
and only accept payments in their own 
cryptocurrency. 
Visuals informed by loved ones could be 
implemented to stay true to the individual and to 
create a meaningful visual representation. Overly 
caricaturized or stylized visual representation of a 
person are not ideal because a partly realistic avatar 
design can fall into the uncanny valley effect. 
Through hyper-realistic avatars, the uncanny valley 
effect may be avoided. However, being confronted 
with a perfectly visualized digital persona of a 
deceased loved one may be psychologically and 
emotionally draining, as it can blur the lines of reality 
and offer an avenue for escapist avoidance instead 
of a healthy processing of grief. 
83
 
Incorporating a boundary to protect against 
disrespectful behavior from unwanted visitors is 
crucial to upholding a respectful environment in the 
immersive memorial space. Adding a password-
protected entry is a good first layer of defense. 
Adding DNA as verification is a foolproof method of 
allowing only biological family members into an 
emotionally sensitive event. However, giving up 
genetic information to a company leaves users 
vulnerable, and at the mercy of the company’s data 
privacy integrity. 
The current practice of sending in DNA 
samples to companies, who are also financially 
involved in curating and upholding memorial 
websites, is developing a dangerous combination of 
personal information online. This suggests a future in 
which an avatar could be authentically replicated 
solely from the information that exists online, 
specifically social media profiles and messages, 
obituaries, and medical information. It can be 
comforting to imagine conversing with an authentic 
representation of a loved one who passed away. 
However, leaving personally sensitive medical data 
in the hands of companies who are profiting from it 
financially, leaves users vulnerable to data misuse. 
84
 
While virtual reality offers a unique creative 
perspective for social gatherings, being 
encompassed in a digital space is not a very human 
experience. Reconsidering technology’s role in 
memorials can help inform design choices that 
heighten interpersonal communication while 
allowing space for individual reflection when 
needed. Through a responsive system that 
recognizes a user's needs, users receive emotional 
support when they need it. By analyzing eye gaze 
and facial expressions, as well as login timing and 
duration, the environment reacts to a user's behavior 
by offering options to contact a mental health 
professional or any online friends when they appear 
to be sad or struggling. Giving users the option to 
connect with others during hard times is a crucial 
aspect of the environment. From collaboration when 
curating the space, to making reaching out to friends 
or therapists accessible and convenient, the space is 
meant to bring people together and make 
communicating easier. 
We hope that Memento Flori will start a 
conversation about what is important in an 
immersive space geared towards group events, and 
how to preserve the human factor in a digital space, 
85
 
especially for a highly personal event like a 
memorial. 
While most online memorials are set up to act 
as public obituaries, the interactive nature of the 
websites, such as publicly accessible messaging 
boards, make them vulnerable to potentially 
disrespectful online behavior. Feelings of 
community, but also the option for privacy, are 
important factors in a virtual funeral setting. The 
emotional factor of a funeral service can come 
through in a digitally immersive environment, as VR 
has been shown to elicit feelings of awe, combat 
feelings of isolation, and facilitate communication 
within a group. While the technical aspects of 
developing an interactive universe for every single 
deceased person is currently questionable from a 
data handling and technical resource perspective, 
the potential for authentic communication from 
avatars, and a virtual environment that meets 
emotional needs, are a promising foundation for a 
future memorial atmosphere that can provide 
helpful, empathetic reactions.

Chapter 3. 
Preserving Memories 
To explore future possibilities of preserving 
memories of a loved one, we present a speculative 
design for a memory capsule product. The capsule, 
based on users DNA, can capture memories, and 
reproduce them as a holographic artwork. 
Developed and sold by Memento Flori, your family 
information and memory processing needs can be 
met all at once! 
3.1. 
Tangible Mementos and Keepsakes 
Personal media files and personal preferences 
are within the public domain on social media 
profiles. With so much personal content available to 
users online, digital files such as photos or videos are 
easily available for use to commemorate a loved one 
within the social media space. However, digital 
artifacts in 2D or 3D virtual spaces lack the physical 
factor of a tangible memento. Massimi and Charise 
[77] narrowed down that need to personal devices
for “reflection and meaning-making across multiple
lifespans” as well as “technological heirlooms”.
Mementos are objects that are representative 
of a place or an experience. The meaning derived 
88
 
from mementos depends on the viewers knowledge 
of it [126]. Van den Hoven and Eggen [127] 
researched intelligent ambient environments 
applied to recalling memories, finding that 57% of 
participants placed value on souvenirs due to the 
attached memories, rather than monetary value or 
aesthetics, and 46% of participants mentioned their 
souvenir was also a meaningful souvenir to other 
people. The three categories Van den Hoven and 
Eggen defined, holiday souvenirs, heirlooms, and 
gifts, all resulted in memory recollection in 
participants [127]. With a physical representation of 
an experience, individuals have a visual trigger to 
recall specific memories.  
When viewed in a group, mementos can 
prompt social interaction. Image and video sharing 
online plays a large role in the development of the 
social media sites we know today, to share 
memories or snapshots of a current moment in time 
[128], [129]. Adding a tangible factor to a digital visual 
has the potential to create meaningful opportunities 
for conversation within a group. Linking physical 
keepsakes to digitally captured memories has been 
previously explored by combining tangible 
representations of memories to their corresponding 
89
 
photographs. Nunes et al. created “Souvenirs”, a 
device that links a physical memento to a digital 
photograph to portray a memory on multiple levels 
and encourage conversation between viewers [128]. 
The tangible representation was created to 
“opportunistically and naturally trigger storytelling in 
a face-to-face domestic environment”. Other work 
has compared photographs to auditory stimuli to 
support social reminiscing. Dib et al. [130] explored 
sound as a keepsake of family vacations, finding that 
sonic souvenirs differed from photos in that they 
were more familial and creative, however they often 
expressed negative or mundane moments, so as to 
be more “true to life”. Though both photos and 
sound clips triggered collaborative reminiscing, 
audio was more difficult to interpret than the images 
[130]. Van den Hoven and Eggen [127] found that 
86% of participants had their souvenir on display in a 
designated place. However, when mementos are 
placed in a home, the familiarity and permanent 
presence may lead to object-blindness [129]; in this 
case, deliberate conversation around a memento 
rarely happens. Offering a unique experience every 
time a memento is interacted with may lessen the 
disinterest that may develop with increased 
familiarity over time. Combining mementos with 
90
 
other artifacts may also incentivize regular use 
despite familiarity. 
Computers have evolved into devices that are 
exclusively used by one person. As more personal 
information gets added to a device, it may become 
unclear how to decipher it far into the future [77]. 
When data is protected by biological measures, 
such as retina scans or fingerprints, unlocking 
information becomes even more complicated after 
death. Upholding biologically based security 
measures can only last as long as a human being. 
Massimi and Charise [77] stressed the importance of 
preparing for data handling after the user who 
created the data is no longer around to decipher it. 
Making arrangements for the continued use or 
deletion of personal data is crucial, especially when 
the data is tied to unique biological measures. When 
planned for accordingly, a personal technological 
device could become a cherished heirloom.  
Considering previous work on mementos and 
their ability to hold meaning and trigger storytelling, 
as well as Massimi’s thanatosensitive approach to 
developing technology, our proposed design for a 
technological heirloom involves creating a personal 
device that holds personally representative 
91
 
mementos over multiple generations and elicits 
conversations between family members. Meaning-
making across multiple lifespans will depend on how 
the device connects family members and its ability 
to portray an authentic representation of a loved 
one.  
3.2. 
Designs and Interactions that Become 
the User 
Kelomees [131] described interactive art as a 
“symbiotic interaction” in which the art has become 
the “viewer”. Products that require an interaction are 
incomplete until the user engages with them. To 
design a memory capsule that becomes an 
everlasting representation of an individual, we 
reviewed existing interactive art installations that 
rely on human input. Kelomees [131] divided a review 
of interactive art installations into four categories: 
distant, contact, bio-based/symbiotic, and chance- 
based interaction. All categories involve a type of 
feedback system, in which users react to the artwork 
and, in turn, elicit a reaction from the artwork. 
Depending on the different interaction styles, 
viewers can interact with the piece from afar, have 
direct contact with the piece, engage with biological 
92
 
detection mechanisms, or try various interactions to 
explore how and when the piece will react [131]. To 
authentically represent a person and their lived 
experience, we researched existing interactive art 
pieces and explored the kinds of interactions users 
could have. 
3.2.1. 
Immersive Art Installations 
Previous work from artists in the interactive 
technology space has taken inspiration from nature, 
focused on large-scale visuals, and has incorporated 
a clear incentive for the audience to participate and 
become a part of the installation. Es Devlin’s “Forest 
of Us” is a maze of mirrors that lead the viewer along 
a set of ramps, reflecting the space all around the 
main path [132]. Visitors follow their own reflection 
through the maze of endless forking roads. Devlin’s 
design was inspired by bifurcating systems found in 
nature, such as tree branches or the airways in lungs 
[132]. 
Other immersive art installations have relied 
on large- scale visuals to make an impact. Recent 
exhibits have incorporated projecting across entire 
rooms, so visitors are surrounded by animated 
visuals. This all-encompassing design is reminiscent 
93
 
of VR world design, which must consider the entire 
space for users to take full advantage of the six 
degrees of freedom VR offers. The global “Van Gogh 
Immersive Experience” exhibit projected Van Gogh’s 
artwork across a large room, having viewers stand in 
the center to watch the visuals change into different 
art pieces [133]. The scale of the projection draws 
viewers in easily, however, the animations simply 
showed images, which then faded into another. 
Walking around was possible, but not necessary. The 
full experience could be watched and understood 
from one vantage point. The “Intangible Forms” 
exhibit by Shohei Fujimoto incorporates lasers 
coordinated with a rhythmic soundtrack [134]. This 
environment is meant to have viewers feel the 
intangible visuals around them in a visceral 
experience [134]. Sounds that correspond with the 
visuals add to the stimuli in the environment, eliciting 
a stronger sense of connection between the viewer 
and the artwork. 
3.2.2. 
Human-entered Interactive Experiences 
When there is a clear incentive to participate 
and be an active part of the installation, visitors can 
experience a sense of ownership and a stronger 
94
 
connection to the artwork. Sean Montgomery’s 
“Emergence” is a biorhythmic light show, in which a 
person’s heartbeat is turned into a visual pattern 
[135]. Visitors will see their own heartbeat 
represented as reactive abstract animations, such as 
colorful pulses of light. Bringing the visitors directly 
into the artwork allows them to fully engage with 
their surroundings and take an active part in the 
experience. 
“Viewer-sensing artworks” are limited in a 
way such that the artwork can’t exist without an 
audience [131]. The evolution of “viewer” to “active 
participant” by interactive art was first defined in 
1990 by Roger F. Malina [136]. Since the artwork 
cannot be experienced without participation, it is not 
a complete work of art until the viewer interacts. 
Kelomees [131] described this state as a “pre-
artwork”, a passive installation that is incomplete 
until the interactor is present and active. An artwork 
with a view of its own encourages the audience to 
continuously engage with the piece. For example, 
OptoIsolator by Golan Levin and Greg Baltus is a 
sculpture of an eye, created to follow viewers as 
they walk around, taking the gaze away from the 
viewer and giving it to their art [137]. However, the 
95
 
lines of privacy become blurred when the audience 
is not aware of that is behind the gaze. The “always 
watchful eye” is a known concept, reminiscent of 
Orwell’s “Big Brother,” watching the population 
through cameras, or in more recent media, Sauron’s 
Eye that constantly surveyed the land in Lord of the 
Rings [138], [139]. Offering an interaction which 
engages audiences can be successful if privacy 
concerns are assuaged and the viewers clearly 
understand how their input will be processed. 
Movement plays a large role in large-scale 
interactive art. Previous work has incorporated 
sensors which respond to viewers' movements to 
create visuals. TeamLab created the Borderless 
exhibition in Tokyo, Japan, using projectors to fill a 
space with visuals across the ceiling, walls, and floors 
[140]. As visitors walk through the space, the visuals 
react. Animations follow the footsteps of people 
walking through the space, turning into something 
new as you enter different areas, and give of the 
feeling of being fully immersed in the artwork [140]. 
The way the artwork moves with the visitor looks 
ethereal and powerful. The ongoing visuals make the 
different areas seem interconnected, but they are 
separate animations and activity zones. The all- 
96
 
encompassing nature of this ongoing, reactive 
animation is impressive, but it can become 
overwhelming. Since there is no way to step outside 
of the animation, the viewer is consistently 
bombarded by light and moving visuals until they 
complete the walkthrough of the space. The art 
collective Breakfast installed a kinetic interactive 
piece, “Pulse” [141]. “Pulse” is a large-scale installation 
at the gym chain, Equinox. It is comprised of large 
rectangular blocks which rotate in response to 
people entering the gym around the world. Data-
driven artwork is useful when representing a certain 
change in activity, such as an increase or decrease. 
The data can be presented in real time, as a one-
shot visual, or asynchronously if users are given the 
option to look at different points in time [141]. 
Other interactive pieces involve live creation 
by the artist. “Revive” by Tatar et al. is a multimedia 
live performance piece exploring AI through 
experimental electronic music [142]. Performing 
with a musical artificial intelligence agent, MASOM, 
Tatar performs a structured improvisation. While the 
sound plays, audio-reactive visuals are projected 
around the space. This interactive soundscape 
97
 
involves three performers – the live coder, the 
musical AI agent, and the visual AI agent [142]. 
Recent interactive installations have 
incorporated the blockchain-based art format, non-
fungible tokens, (NFTs). At Art Basel 2022, Tezos 
created an interactive installation in which visitors 
were able to generate a self-portrait, which was 
immediately minted as an NFT and gifted to the 
viewer [143]. This creation depended on visitors’ 
willingness to participate, and, in the end, their 
willingness to accept an NFT on the Tezos 
blockchain. Incorporating a surprising element, such 
as the gift of an NFT, can draw visitors in and pique 
their interest in subjects they may not have explored 
before. These chance-based interactions can 
engage users over a longer period of time, due to 
the suspense of unexpected results [131].

3.2.3. 
After Life Design 
Contemporary urn designs have explored 
products and services which may be useful for burial 
or bereavement. Future concepts included designs 
geared towards saving physical space, rethinking 
the visual style of urns, and processing a user's 
digital footprint. 
Foreverence offers a series of custom urns. 
Their urns are 3D-printed containers that are 
individually designed to visually represent a loved 
one’s interests or personal experiences [144]. The 
designs include playful shapes and realistic 
representations of a person’s activities and interests, 
such as a favorite car, a family home, or an 
instrument. These personalized urns are reminiscent 
of the fantasy coffins made in Ghana [53], [145] 
(Figure 2, 3, 4), which are also designed around an 
individual’s occupation or favorite past-times, and 
colorfully painted for a bright and eye-catching 
appearance. In stark contrast, contemporary urn 
designs have looked towards simpler shapes and 
dark or muted colors. Wolfgang Natlacen’s Misirizzi 
is an oblong rounded black shape that wobbles if 
knocked over (Figure 24) [146]. Misirizzi was 
designed to be played with, encouraging interaction 
100
 
between the living and the dead [146]. Aleksander 
Skworz’s “Living Urn” was designed to be used 
during life as well as after death [147]. Designed as a 
simple container with a lid, the jar can be used to 
store items as needed. White marble and wooden 
texture make the container an unassuming, useful 
addition to a household, to be repurposed as an urn 
after death. Users are meant to use the urn regularly 
as a daily reminder of their mortality [147]. Tom 
Kundig’s “Final Turn” Urn is a steel sphere, split in 
two halves (Figure 25) [148]. The urn holds two 
compartments, for remains and personal items. The 
edge of the split sphere can be engraved, which can 
only be seen when the urn is open. The simple and 
discreet design is a minimalistic and thoughtful way 
to also hold on to personal mementos that were 
important to the deceased. 
Some speculative urn designs have explored 
products and services which may be useful for burial 
or bereavement. Sadauskaite’s design a wall-
mounted urn display, to demonstrate the 
connectivity between loved ones (Figure 26) [149]. 
Hexagonal compartments offer space for small urns 
or mementos. Making space for personal artifacts is 
a thoughtful way to preserve memories in the form 
101
 
of physical mementos. Both Kundig’s [148] sphere 
and Sadauskaite’s [149] hexagon containers have 
storage space for small keepsakes that hold 
sentimental value.

3.3. 
Defining Memories 
To preserve a memory, we must evaluate 
what can be preserved, and what can authentically 
represent a person. The preserved artifact must be 
long-lasting, and it must be understandable across 
generations. 
Changes in emotional state, environmental 
stressors, and lifestyle impact our bodies. These 
effects can potentially be detected and analyzed to 
trace memories back for generations. The 
microscopic pattern of water has been shown to 
change after encountering different environments 
[150], [151]. Kröplin and Henschel investigated how 
water picks up and retains information of the places 
it has traveled through and found a change in its 
microscopic visual pattern after being in contact 
with different flowers [151]. Tears have a different 
microscopic visual pattern when they have different 
causes [152], [153]. For example, tears from cutting 
onions will differ from tears resulting from joy, or 
heartbreak. In this case, emotion and environmental 
change are detectable in water, even in bodily fluids 
like tears [150], [150], [152], [153]. 
103
 
Through a combination of surveys, genetic 
analysis, and statistical probabilities, many seemingly 
minute details have been evaluated by genetic 
testing companies. Genetic testing has become a 
popular practice with the emergence of DNA 
handling companies such as 23andme and Ancestry 
[8], [9]. These companies analyze genetic material to 
show customers their family tree, any potential 
health concerns based on genetic factors and family 
history, as well as personal likes and dislikes. These 
personal predictions are made down to the smallest 
detail, such as ice cream flavor preference.  
Genetics can also offer insight to an 
individual’s lived experiences. Epigenetics refers to 
the study of changes in genomic expression in due 
to external influences. These changes are 
phenotypic, and do not alter the gene sequence 
itself [154]. 
Genes can be expressed later in life through 
chemical modification of DNA. Modifications that 
regulate gene activity include the addition of a 
methyl group to a DNA molecule [154]. For 
methylation to occur, a person would find 
themselves in an extremely stress-inducing 
environment, resulting in the expression of a gene. 
104
 
DNA methylation is noticeable in the form of 
“epigenetic tags,” which are heritable [154], [155]. 
Environmental effects can therefore influence the 
gene expression of future offspring. While 
epigenetic tags are heritable, their consistent 
expression remains unclear [155]. Current research 
has found that epigenetic tags are not always 
inherited in a stable way, such that their effect's 
extent and duration may vary [155], [156]. While 
there is still more research to be done on this topic, 
it is currently known that changes in gene 
expression can occur as a result of external 
environments. Over time,  the presence of 
epigenetic tags on DNA could act as a timeline of 
memories, demonstrating at what stage changes 
were expressed and how long they lasted during a 
generation. 
A memory could be a shared genetic trait, 
passed down for generations, but only expressed 
decades later. A memory could be a shared feeling. 
Generational experiences differ depending on 
economic, societal, and environmental factors. 
Shared experiences can span across multiple 
generations, for example if certain generations were 
young when encountering economic recessions that 
occurred decades apart, or if a major health crisis 
105
 
happened at a critical stage in development for 
different generations. Similar stressors could be 
recognized, demonstrating a shared experience, 
despite these family members having never met. 
3.4. 
Memento Flori Memory Capsules 
For this speculative design, based on current 
interest in genetic testing kits, as well as current 
research in epigenetics, we assume that in the 
future, memories can be retained in biological 
matter. To preserve a memory, genetic material or 
bodily fluids can be collected to use as a vessel for a 
person’s traits and memories, even after they are 
gone. Currently, DNA collection is simple. 
Customers receive a kit, take their own saliva sample, 
and send it back in an already prepared box. To 
create a customized experience, Memento Flori 
offers a personal device which does the genetic 
analysis directly in the customer’s home. 
3.4.1. 
Data Integrity 
Current methods, such as filming and 
photography, allow us to capture moments in time 
and save them for future generations. While 
technologies may become obsolete over time, it is 
106
 
possible to convert and transfer older files into new 
formats. Videos and images are an easily obtained 
visual and auditory representation of a person; 
however, they can be digitally altered. Through 
artificial intelligence algorithms, it is currently 
possible to create realistic videos of human speech 
and movement, inserting any character into a scene. 
These “deepfake” videos are difficult to discern from 
a filmed video, as a person’s pronunciation, speech 
patterns, and facial expressions can be accurately 
imitated [157], [158]. This may lead to fake artifacts 
being preserved, with no possibility of verifying their 
integrity in the future. To decrease the probability of 
fake information being spread, Memento Floris 
memory capsule relies on biological input to 
preserve authentic memories. Memento Floris DNA 
kits allow users to send in their DNA for analysis, to 
verify their identity and display their family tree in 
the virtual environment. The diverse database of 
personal preferences, family history, and medical 
information in Memento Floris care allows for 
complex information to be extracted. Based on data 
privacy concerns of the social media age, Memento 
Flori could offer a personal product that can be used 
at home. Instead of allowing a company to process a 
107
 
user's DNA, the product is a personal object that a 
user can keep and pass down within their family. 
Blood, saliva, or tears are all sources of DNA 
that can be analyzed. Collecting saliva is a non-
invasive collection method, and a reliable source of 
DNA for genotyping [152], [159]. However, bacterial 
contamination may result in an inconclusive analysis 
[159]. Blood contains a high amount of DNA and is 
efficient for DNA analysis [159], [160]. However, users 
may not be willing to take part in an invasive 
procedure. Tear stains containing low amounts of 
DNA have also been shown to provide a reliable DNA 
profile [152]. Tear structure reacts to external and 
internal influences, such as a harsh external 
environment, or changes in emotion [152], [153]. 
DNA derived from bone powder was found to be 
useful up to 44 years after burial [161]. Bone chips are 
also a viable DNA source [162]. Looking to the future, 
extracting memories from deceased individuals 
could offer insight to the experiences after death. 
Adding environmental and emotional information to 
the memory capsule would result in a richer 
memory hologram.  
108
 
3.4.2. 
Using the Capsule 
Users have multiple options to add DNA to the 
capsule: they can swab their cheek for cells and 
saliva, or they can prick their finger to add blood to 
the capsule. If informed consent is obtained, bone 
powder can be used to extract memories after 
death. If a user consents, they can opt into 
exhumation and processing of their bones, for 
additional memories to be extracted. Exhumation 
and maintaining bodies after death is common 
practice in some cultures, such as the “turning of the 
bones” in Madagascar and the “care of ancestors” 
ritual in Indonesia [55], [59]. In cultures that view 
exhumation as a disturbance or disrespectful, such 
as in Christianity or Islam, users may not be willing to 
partake in this process [62], [163]. 
The proposed function of the memory 
capsule is to analyze a user's DNA to extract 
memories, creating a holographic artwork based on 
the genetic material. Though the DNA may degrade 
over time, the visual information derived from the 
DNA can be saved and played back as often as 
needed. A user can decide to link their memory kit 
to an existing chain or use it as an individual capsule. 
The product can appeal to either individualistic or 
109
 
collectivistic cultures, as it can be a personal 
experience, building a timeline of your own 
memories to share at will, or a group experience, in 
which all family members add their memories to an 
ongoing chain of preserved ancestral images. 
The DNA-based capsule comes in two tiers. 
The standard memory capsule can be used for 
biological families. Memory kits with matching DNA 
recognize each other and are open to connecting 
and combining visuals as shared memories are 
found. The premium capsule offers an open-source 
connection – the connection is not dependent on 
matching DNA samples to function. Some users may 
be estranged from their family and may prefer to 
connect with their friends. Some may want to create 
an ongoing family tree and include spouses in their 
capsule chain. If a standard capsule is attached to a 
premium capsule, the shared memories will only 
appear if genetics are shared. Otherwise, only 
individual memories will be projected. 
3.4.3. 
Interactions 
Interacting with the capsule incorporates a 
two-tiered approach. Building off Kelomees’ [131] 
categorizations of interactive artwork, the initial 
110
 
interaction will be a bio-based interaction. The 
second type of interaction will be a set of two 
contact interactions. 
Bio-based/symbiotic  
Interaction 
The swab attached to the lid can be used to 
collect skin cells from the inside of the mouth. For a 
blood sample, the swab can be removed to reveal a 
lancet. Replacement swabs and lancets are available 
for purchase, as they must be replaced after each 
use. Once the memory has been extracted, the 
capsule can be opened, and the swab or lancet can 
be discarded. The DNA is then processed and 
analyzed by the capsule. After the insertion and 
analysis of the DNA, the images will be portrayed as 
a holographic artwork, projected above the capsule. 
Users can add DNA repeatedly, as new memories 
are formed, and new life events are experienced. 
Every added memory will be converted into a 
visually animated holographic sequence. 
Contact  
Interactions 
Single Contact Interaction 
When a user wants to activate their capsule 
to display memories, they can set the capsule on a 
111
 
surface and press down. The capsule clicks into 
place and begins to project the holographic artwork. 
Memories can be viewed to reminisce and process 
experiences from a different perspective. If a user is 
far away from their family, collecting memories and 
adding them to the capsule can be a way of 
preparing for a reunion, in anticipation of sharing the 
memories upon return. 
Group Contact Interaction 
Meeting online in a virtual space is a useful 
alternative for those who have time or distance 
constraints. However, for an event as important as a 
memorial, being in a group of people, face to face, 
can offer an uplifting sense of community. By giving 
users a personal object, instead of forcing them to 
enter a virtual environment, we can place the 
memories directly into users’ hands. To encourage 
collaboration and communication, the product 
includes a mechanism that allows users to 
experience the product together. 
Families can display their collection of 
capsules together as a connected chain. The 
interlocking system lets capsules communicate with 
each other as memories are portrayed. Shared 
emotion, experiences, and genetic traits can be 
recognized and taken into account when capsules 
are connected. In a grid of capsules, pressing down 
on one of them will result in a chain reaction; the 
connected capsules will click into place and begin 
displaying the contained memories shortly after the 
first contact. The memory capsule that was 
activated acts as the initiator; any shared memories 
will reach out from the active capsule and be 
portrayed together. Shared memories will overlap 
and intertwine as they appear.

simple two-step process: a bio-based interaction, 
to protect from false input, results in a visual

Modular 
designs
The memory capsules are available for individual 
use, as well as sharing memories as a group. Designing 
an object that encapsulates a lifetime of memories calls 
for a modular system, to be able to interlock and build a 
structure that can be expanded upon as family members 
are added. For an interconnected system that can be 
added to in the future, we looked at patterns that would 
allow users to build continuously. Tessellations are a 
pattern of shapes that can continue endlessly (Figure 
28). For a modular system, the memory capsule shape 
must be able to fit into a tessellated pattern.

multiple shapes. This tessellation can be 
built by using either a hexagon and a 
diamond, or a hexagon and two triangles.

made of a singular shape,

Tessellations
We visualized a combination of patterns to 
explore the connective options (Figure 28 ). In the 
end, we chose the hexagon pattern, because of its 
ability to be an ergonomically comfortable shape to 
hold as a single object, as well as the possibility to 
connect triangle-shaped add-ons, as a possibility for 
capsule upgrades in the future, without breaking the 
pattern structure (Figure 29, Figure 30 ).

The capsule has a hexagonal shape 
which connects at the sides to form a

chip on one side, and a chip reader on the 
other allow for communication between 
capsules. When one is active, the connected 
capsules will read the activity status and turn 
on as well, resulting in a chain reaction of 
memories being portrayed.

Depicting Memories 
Neustaedter and Federovskaya researched 
memory sharing in virtual worlds compared to real 
life practices, suggesting that larger, projected 
visuals have the potential for richer intergroup 
interactions as opposed to huddling around a small 
screen [164]. Allowing movement makes for a more 
enjoyable social experience when viewing media 
content to share memories. Personal devices as a 
projection tool for group viewing can spark 
storytelling or reminiscing more easily, due to the 
comfortable group setting that is not constrained by 
physical space. 
The projections created by the capsule are 
artificial intelligence (AI) generated holograms. 
Based on the DNA input, the memories will be 
analyzed, and the AI will generate an animated 
holographic artwork. The AI algorithm will look for 
similarities in content and material. The database it 
searches will include any connected capsules, their 
stored DNA and already generated memory 
animations. The lenses will then project shared 
memories between capsules to visualize the 
connection. When viewing the memories, the chain 
of capsules works together to create an ongoing, 
124
 
cohesive holographic artwork. The more capsules 
are connected to the chain, the larger and more 
intricate the artwork will become.  
Viewers are active participants in creating the 
experience. The user becomes part of the capsule 
by adding their DNA to it, which will then be 
transformed into an abstract visual by an AI art 
generator. AI generated art can dial into detail or 
remain obscure and abstract, depending on user 
input. The stronger the DNA sample, the richer the 
memory will be. This may include more visual detail, 
more color, or more complex emotions and 
experiences being represented in the holographic 
projection. (Visual examples of what a memory 
could look like are explored in depth in chapter 4.3.) 
3.5. 
Summary 
In interactive installations, shifting the active 
role to the art piece results in a communication of 
sorts between the viewer and the artwork. The more 
active one is, the more active the other will become. 
This symbiotic activity leads to strong engagement 
between viewer and artwork. Incorporating other 
senses, such as sounds, or scents, can heighten the 
engagement and bring more dimension to the 
125
 
visuals, some of which are not possible in a virtual 
environment. 
Memento Floris memory capsule illustrates 
how social connections could possibly be retained in 
DNA in the future. The memories are based on 
genetic material and are therefore an authentic 
representation of relationships. When subjects are 
aware of cameras, or when posting to social media, 
insecurities can override an authentic image. Posing 
a certain way, or heavily photoshopping an image, 
may lead to an aesthetically pleasing image, but it 
does not represent an authentic moment or 
emotion. 
This product is a tangible object, to 
incorporate into family rituals. The main goal of the 
memory capsule product is to offer an opportunity 
for a shared experience. Coming together to watch 
images uniquely curated by loved ones could 
become a family tradition. Memory capsules can be 
connected and maintained in a designated space at 
home. When a chain of capsules is created, families 
have a tangible representation of their family tree. 
The connection to past ancestors can be upheld and 
revisited to show their continued presence in their 
family’s memory. Collecting a loved one’s last 
126
memories and adding them to the family chain 
could become a ritual for families to experience 
together.

Chapter 4. 
The Art of Memories 
This chapter explores AI-generated art and its 
ability to portray a user’s intended meaning derived 
from keyword input. The process of adjusting and 
testing keywords to generate new art pieces allows 
exploration of how AI-generated art could be 
authentically representative of a loved one. 
Current generative art platforms prompt 
users to enter keywords or images. The generated 
image or video will take on characteristics described 
by the keywords or seen in the example image. The 
user can then decide to change their input, until the 
desired result is achieved, or to continue in the visual 
direction of the generated image. Many adjustments 
may be necessary until the final piece is created. 
Instead of mastering brushstrokes or color mixing, 
the current learning process is to select the correct 
keyword combination, or to find a source image that 
can be restructured to fit the new artistic direction. 
To create examples of the visuals Memento Floris 
memory capsules could generate, we explored AI-
generated art by creating pieces centered around 
stages of life.

Visualization Methods 
4.1.1. 
Human Characteristics in Visual Design 
Given current virtual reality (VR) technology, 
we can expect life-like avatars in the future, which 
will allow people to interact with a visual 
representation of their loved ones after they die. An 
avatar is no replacement for a human life, but it 
could be comforting to engage in familiar 
communication to remember people long after they 
pass away. There are businesses which offer 
machine learning services to analyze and learn from 
online messaging and posting behavior to build an 
avatar that will communicate in a person’s authentic 
voice, including their writing mannerisms and tone 
of voice [116]. However, avatar visuals are difficult to 
produce, as they can fall into the uncanny valley 
effect and appear more disconcerting than 
comforting [165]–[167]. Human empathy towards 
non-human entities fluctuates depending on to 
which degree the entity appears human. There is a 
substantial dip in empathy around the 70% mark of 
“humanness” [165], [167] (Figure 40).  
130
 
The Uncanny Valley in Research
Figure 40. Meah and 
Moore [103] mapped out 
the uncanny valley dip that 
appears at around 70% human-
likeness.
Figure 41. A robot-human 
spectrum developed by 
Weis and Wiese [150]. 
131
 
Weis and Wiese [165] morphed an image of a 
human face with an image of a robot to varying 
degrees to investigate the foundation of the 
uncanny valley effect (Figure 41). Cognitive conflict 
peaked in the uncanny valley region, suggesting that 
it causes the eerie feeling perceived when looking at 
a face that has almost human characteristics [165] 
(Figure 40). 
The uncanny valley reaction is also seen in 
art [14, 113, 134] (Figures 37, 38). Uncanny art 
pieces occur when artists have a realistic painting 
style, but do not finalize the details to fall into the 
hyper-realist realm [113]. 3D modeling systems 
have come far, and currently produce hyper-
realistic avatars. However, Shin et al [133] found 
that the uncanny valley effect is still present with 
hyper-realistic human renderings, and it is even 
more pronounced when they are animated, 
versus still images.

Artificial Intelligence Art 
Previous investigations into the 
perception of computer- generated art have 
evaluated peoples’ ability to distinguish 
between computer-made or human-made 
art, categorized the aesthetic value of
132
 
The Uncanny Valley in Art
133
 
work from artificial intelligence (AI) generators, and 
demonstrated biases against AI art. Elgammal et al. 
[11] used a Creative Adversarial Network (CAN) to
create unique contemporary art pieces. When
comparing paintings, participants could not
differentiate between AI-generated paintings versus
paintings created by contemporary artists [11].
Previous studies have investigated 
preferences and biases towards AI art. Chamberlain 
et al. [172] found implicit and explicit biases against 
AI art when compared to art created by humans. 
Participants perceived the AI art to have a lower 
aesthetic value. When rating unlabeled art pieces, 
from either an Art Basel exhibition or AI- generated 
art pieces, subjects preferred the AI-generated art 
over the human-created pieces [172]. Viewers do 
see value in AI-generated art if they don’t know a 
machine created it. This bias also encompasses the 
visual style of the art piece. Gangadharbatla [173] 
found human participants more likely to attribute 
abstract art to machines, and representational art to 
human artists. 
Some argue that understanding ideas or 
experiencing emotions should not be a prerequisite 
for producing “meaningful” and evocative art [131], 
134
 
[173], [174]. When using the AI art creator, 
Midjourney, Chatterjee [174] added the keyword 
phrase: “evokes a feeling of awe” into the art 
prompt, resulting in a new image. If the user 
considers emotion as a motivation for creating the 
art piece, AI models have the potential to generate 
emotionally evocative art pieces without being able 
to feel or understand emotion. AI can create 
emotionally charged visuals, just as humans can 
create mechanical, abstract art [27, 58]. 
AI-generated art has recently gained 
popularity in the mainstream, as seen in social 
media trends on the video creation platform, 
Tiktok [19]. There are multiple AI art filters on 
Tiktok; some are keyword-based, and require a 
written prompt, others are image-based, for 
which users take a photo or upload an image, 
which is then transformed by an AI art filter into a 
specific style [13], [19], [175], [176]. AI apps such as 
Lensa created an AI art filter which is currently 
trending, being used on 11.2 M videos 
[13], [177].

Applications of AI Art 
in Mainstream Media

136
 
Other portrait filters, like the AI Manga filter, 
currently used on 154.4 M videos [178]. This filter 
creates a stylized avatar in various styles when users 
take pictures of their faces. One popular AI art 
generator called the “Time Machine”, from 
MyHeritage, shows users what they would look like 
in different eras, creating digital portraits in various 
styles from different periods in history [179]. 
However, due to the high volume of user activity, the 
filters often glitch and show the message “AI is busy, 
try again later,” (Figure 44). 
The rush in activity towards these face-based 
AI art generators stems in part from the current 
social media style, which has developed into a 
storytelling vlog style, including personal 
vulnerabilities. These vlogs mainly show the face 
front and center. This personal approach to media 
has demonstrated users’ interest in being portrayed 
with desirable facial features in a digital format. 
Using filters that constantly distort facial features or 
body shapes can lead to an unrealistic expectation 
of what a person looks like. Developing an unrealistic 
mental image makes it extremely uncomfortable to 
look in the mirror and be confronted with reality 
when skewed expectations are not met. Generating 
art immediately brings users instant gratification, but 
the apps often cannot keep up with the current 
volume of interest. Adding another stream of 
unrealistic body and facial feature standards for 
young users to interact with makes so called 
“realistic” portrait creation a dangerous application 
of AI generated art. Moving away from human-like 
portraiture and using AI-generated art for 
imaginative world building, or for futuristic 
speculation, is a less harmful application of these AI 
models. 
4.3. 
Creating with AI 
Due to the high amount of interest AI has 
garnered on social media, many companies have 
been creating their own platforms and developing 
AI art generators to offer a wide range of options to 
users. AI art generators such as Midjourney, Dall-E 2, 
Runway ML, offer options to create images based on 
keywords, offering both realistic and abstract visuals 
as the output [12], [176], [180]. The visual style is 
determined by the user. Most AI art generators offer 
a variety of stylistic options, based on what the AI 
has analyzed and catalogued from existing art 
137
 
138
 
online. For example, AI art generators such as Dall-E 
are trained by analyzing millions of images online 
and their captions. This process incorporates a text 
encoder, which takes user keywords as input, and 
maps the words to a corresponding visual. This 
visual is pieced together by the image decoder to 
create a novel image based on the keywords [181], 
[182]. 
AI art generative models rely on existing art to 
develop their images. On AI art platforms, such as 
Nightcafe or DeepAI, users can choose a 
predetermined visual style for the generator to 
emulate [175], [183]. Once the image output is 
available, many AI art generators offer multiple 
choices for users to select an image that aligns most 
with their input. Sometimes the images develop in a 
surprising way, which the artist can choose to 
ignore, or redirect their art process by continuing 
their art generation with a new image. Due to this 
iterative process, AI art is a unique, collaborative 
experience for artists to expand on their ideas 
through unexpected results. Overall, sourcing from 
online content without artists permission or notifying 
original creators is unethical. However, the potential 
of AI technology offering an iterative process, 
139
 
without relying on other people, or potentially 
making connections to new collaborators, is a 
benefit that should not be ignored.  
There are opportunities for AI art to be 
created ethically, at the very least including credit to 
the original artists the styles are being sourced from. 
Streamlining viewer input from an audience that is 
not formally educated in art is easily done through AI 
art generators. When viewers knew that an artwork 
was created by AI, they ranked it worse than human-
made art [184]. However, when evaluating a group of 
art pieces, viewers could not determine which 
pieces were AI-generated and which were painted 
by human artists [184]. Though AI-generated art is 
not highly regarded by viewers, AI art can embody 
emotional concepts, which could change public 
perception. When the art is created to reflect a 
loved one who has passed away, the connection to 
the art piece could become more personal. Further 
studies on participant reports about the feeling 
evoked by an AI artwork would be useful, to see if it 
corresponds with the intended result. If AI can 
reliably evoke emotion in humans, it does not need 
to understand a particular emotion, but could 
categorize it, nonetheless. 
140
 
Massimi et al. [20] argued for a lifespan-
oriented approach to HCI design, stating that, while 
many designs are focused on age ranges, or certain 
age groups (e.g. children, the elderly), more focus 
should be placed on the end-of-life as an important 
life stage to design for, as it fits within traditional HCI 
design practice limitations including ethical 
boundaries, vulnerable groups, and personal identity 
question. Considering life stages as a framework and 
using an AI art generator as a tool for visual ideation 
lead to a grid of images representing a lifespan. 
Creating a general overview in abstract imagery 
using multiple AI models can help visualize any 
differences in output, while also offering insight on 
the visual direction seen in certain stages of life. To 
converge onto clear visual examples, I began by 
narrowing down a visual style. Because the memory 
capsule will project a hologram, the goal was to 
create colorful, holographic-looking images that 
could potentially be projected by the capsule. The 
process involved entering phrases describing 
different stages of life, changing the context if 
images did not fit the brief, but keeping the visual 
style consistent. 
4.3.1. 
Visual Style 
By looking at personal information, such as 
beliefs, likes and dislikes, and personal style, an 
abstract visual could be built to better represent a 
person without using human characteristics that 
have the potential to fall short or evoke negative 
emotions due to an inauthentic appearance, given 
the current state of AI. Having an abstract 
representation of a memory allows for further 
development of the visual style, making it a good 
starting point for ideation. Once an image is hyper-
realistic, it cannot be improved upon to be more 
accurate or detailed, unless the content and subject 
of the image is changed. Hyper-realistic images 
draw less attention and interest from viewers 
because there is so little left to interpretation [12]. By 
letting viewers see artwork from their own lens, they 
can also have a more personal experience when 
viewing or interacting with it. Giving users a 
personally engaging experience is vital to creating a 
meaningful product. Therefore, to create a broad 
strokes overview of a lifespan, we chose to proceed 
with abstract visuals. 
The stable diffusion AI model provides a 
variety of visual styles that give a predefined look to 
141
 
142
 
keywords. For example, there are abstract paint, 
cubist, and realistic portrait presets, among others. 
These presets act as visual guidelines when 
generating keywords. For our project, we began 
testing the abstract paint filter, neon lights filter, as 
well as no style preset, to identify differences in 
outcome. Then, we used the Dall-e 2 art generator, 
which has no presets, to determine if there were any 
differences in visual style and content. 
4.3.2. 
Keyword Development 
Keyword phrases were developed by defining 
the life stage in terms of time, then adding the word 
“life,” because each image is meant to represent a 
certain stage in life. The image style was defined by 
adding visually descriptive words. The visual style 
was kept consistent for all image generations. To 
stay within the confines of the memory capsule 
product, a term referring to hologram visuals was 
needed. To avoid uncanny representations of human 
beings, the word “abstract” was an important 
qualifier for all images. In the end, the words 
“holographic” and ”abstract” were added to every 
key phrase. 
143
 
To account for any differences in word order, 
the temporal keyword was added first in the initial 
generation, then added to the end in the second 
generation. The key phrase structure was as follows: 
visual style ・ descriptor ・“life”・ timeline 
timeline ・“life”・ visual style ・ descriptor 
To capture an overlapping universal 
experience, I chose to create visuals that depict the 
stages of life: childhood, teenage life, adulthood, and 
elderly life. Because memories overlapping across 
generations will include timelines outside of life, we 
also added “death”, “afterlife”, and “before life” as 
keywords. Each keyword phrase was entered into 
the two AI art generators, along with the keyword 
“abstract,” as well as the keyword “holographic,” to 
define the visual style. 
The keyword groups were the following: 
•
before life abstract holographic
•
early conception life abstract holographic
•
childhood life abstract holographic
144
 
•
teenage life abstract holographic
•
adult life abstract holographic
•
elderly life abstract art holographic
•
afterlife abstract holographic
•
death abstract holographic
4.3.3. 
AI-generated Image Comparison 
I used the online platform, Nightcafe, which 
offers multiple generative AI models. I chose to use 
two different models for comparison. The first was a 
stable diffusion algorithm, which is a text-to-image 
machine learning model that generates images by 
progressively de-noising them. The second is Dall-e 
2, an encoder/decoder model, which uses natural 
language descriptions to create original images 
[194]. The same keywords were used in two different 
agents, to see if there were noticeable differences in 
quality and content. 
The full overview of keywords and generated 
images is displayed in Figure 45.

When there were results that did 
not meet the brief, such as text placement, 
or a literal representation, despite the 
”abstract” constraint, the phrase was 
adjusted, and the generative model was 
rerun. Synonyms describing the timeline, 
such as “senior life” instead of “elderly life,” 
were exchanged to see the differences in 
outcome due to semantics. If blocks of text 
or frames were added to the images, the 
prompt was rerun without adjusting the 
keywords. This resulted in regenerating the 
prompt in a similar style, but with different
visual content. In the end, we narrowed down 
the results to one image per category from 
each generative model. Filtering based on 
common color schemes and cohesive layouts
lead to the result on the right (Figure 46).

Personal Memories 
 After developing this broader overview to 
explore the general use of AI models, I took a 
personal approach in developing a memory image. 
Memories are unique and hold sentimental value, so 
an abstract representation may not be enough to 
trigger storytelling or reminiscing [128]. To bring a 
personal aspect into my artistic practice, I used an AI 
model to create an image of a relative I never got to 
meet.  
My maternal grandfather died before I was 
born. I never had the chance to interact with him, 
but I know we share a passion for art. He was 
primarily a watercolor artist, who focused on nature 
landscapes in the region of Bavaria and Northern 
Austria. My mother’s home is filled with his 
landscape paintings, oil portraits, and linocuts. 
Creating my own memento of him and his artwork is 
a way of connecting to my past through personally 
relevant digital media.

I found a photograph of my 
grandfather and uploaded a 
landscape painting of his. Using a 
style transfer AI model, I combined 
the artistic style of his watercolor 
landscape with his photograph.

 Bringing more of a painterly 
texture to the portrait, the 
landscape image style and 
brushstrokes were used, but the 
portrait is clearly visible.

The landscape 
image was used as 
a base, and the 
portrait image was 
transferred onto it 
as a style guideline. 
The portrait developed into a 
painted image, keeping texture 
from the suit and collar and 
blending it within the 
environment of the landscape.

Here, an eye and nose are 
visible in the lower half of the 
image. The suit texture has 
taken over the background and 
filled in the trees and shadows.

Sometimes, the style transfer acted more as a 
visual filter than an application of a visual style. I 
preferred the more abstract version that picked up 
his outfit, because it seemed to carry him over into 
his work. Leaving a piece of himself within his 
painting but not portraying him directly in it felt 
more appropriate, because it was a way to 
acknowledge his absence but still recognize him in 
the image.

Summary 
Current Generative  
AI Art Creation 
To develop some examples of the images 
Memento Floris time capsules could portray, I 
compared a stable diffusion art generator to the 
Dall-e 2 art generator. Through this process, I looked 
at the differences between models and tried a 
combination of keywords describing the stages of 
life, applying Massimi’s [20] life stages approach to 
the categories, including before life and after death. 
To allow for personal interpretation, and to avoid 
inauthentic representations of a person, these art 
pieces are an abstract representation. To stay within 
154
 
Social Opportunities  
for AI-Generated Art 
this consistent visual style, the keyword “abstract” 
was included in each generation. 
The process of going through various 
keyword combinations can be tedious. Though the 
visuals are of a high quality, narrowing down specific 
topics, contexts, and aesthetic choices can be 
frustrating when the desired result is not achieved. 
The potential for surprising results makes 
experimenting with AI art useful for ideation. 
However, AI- generated art is not the best tool for 
the creation of a specific desired outcome. 
Geometric clean designs, specifically, are difficult to 
achieve. 
With AI art generators, users have the 
opportunity to generate unique content and derive 
personal meaning from it. Applying a life-stages 
oriented approach opens designers to placing death 
at the forefront of creation, by taking inspiration 
from past family members or creating art meant for 
future generations [20], [78].  
Parasocial relationships with public figures 
can develop simply by watching their content online, 
155
 
especially with the current trend of narrative style 
video content. Gleason et al. [185] found that 
adolescent social media users view celebrities they 
admire as relationship partners, due to the personal 
nature of regularly sharing content online. These types 
of connections are one-sided, but they transcend a 
screen. Parasocial relationships could also occur for 
deceased family members, as new generations come 
along that did not have a chance to meet them in 
person. Creating a memory with an ancestor by using 
generative visuals to continue their presence in 
current times has the potential to produce real, 
meaningful memories. When a face-to-face 
interaction is not possible, the memories created can 
create a bond to past relatives. The bond may be one-
sided, but it is a way to bring the memory of a loved 
one into present times by way of a visual or physical 
representation. 
Co-creation in immersive spaces has been 
shown to evoke meaningful storytelling [121]. If 
memorial AI art creation is done with family members, 
potentially family members who have a closer familial 
bond to the deceased, the creation process could 
expand into a social activity, including reminiscing and 
sharing various perspectives on a loved one’s life.  
156
 
Generating an AI visual is accessible to a wide 
range of users, not only classically trained artists. The 
accessibility, along with the opportunity to build a 
connection to someone who cannot actively 
respond, can offer an opportunity to create and 
uphold meaningful familial memories after death.

Chapter 5. 
Conclusion and Future Work 
Through a speculative design approach, we 
explored the benefits and drawbacks of virtual 
memorials, and use these insights to develop a 
design concept for a memory preserver of the 
future. This work is presented within the context of 
the fictional business, Memento Flori, which offers 
users digital and tangible solutions to preserving 
their identity in the future. First, we present a design 
concept for a virtual metaverse funeral. To illustrate 
a potential future where memorials are routinely 
held in immersive spaces, I produced digital 
artifacts, including a business website and concept 
sketches. 
Inspired by the potential for a digital timeline 
that can be created when families routinely upload 
their memories to a virtual environment, Memento 
Flori also offers a memory capsule product. 
Additional artifacts in the form of a product design 
for a DNA-based projector, showcased by graphic 
designs, are included as an exploration into a 
tangible representation of memories.  
Connections that transcend screens have 
been observed with public figures on social media. 
159
 
AI art can generate images of family members who 
have passed away, giving users a way to engage 
with their memory after death. Keeping Massimi’s 
lifespan-oriented approach in mind, I created an 
overview of abstract life stage images to compare AI 
models, and to explore the keyword development 
process [20], [77]. For a more personal application of 
AI generators, I also created images of my maternal 
grandfather using a style transfer AI model. By 
creating with a loved one in mind, the artistic 
process can lead to a new memory with family 
members who have passed away.   
With this work, I explore ideas about how 
technology will evolve to support passing on 
generational information over long periods of time. I 
contribute design concepts for a virtual memorial 
service as well as a memory preservation product, 
with the aim to initiate a conversation around what 
parts of an identity can be preserved after 
someone’s passing, and what form memories can 
take on for different individuals.

Discussion 
Research Goals 
Working towards our research goals, we 
applied a combination of graphic, website, and 
product design to create a corporate and visual 
context for our proposed memorials and memorial 
rituals of the future. These artifacts are available 
online to view as a design project. Within this work, 
the focus was placed on the creation of digital 
artifacts and graphic designs. 
Goal 1. 
Create a meaningful and respectful memorial 
experience in an immersive virtual environment 
When developing the space for Memento 
Flori’s virtual world, the designs were built around 
allowing users privacy during times of grief, as well 
as offering users unintrusive but easy opportunities 
to connect with others. With user safety and mental 
health at the forefront of the design, the Memento 
Flori map shows designated areas where users are 
shielded from interactions when they prefer to be 
alone. Privacy without isolation was crucial, which 
161
 
lead to the concept of reactive functionality of the 
system. Users opting into facial expression 
recognition lets Memento Flori walk the line 
between giving users space and offering a two-click 
connection to friends and family. 
Massimi et al. [14] suggested future work 
supporting death-centric practices in the areas of 
bequeathing of digital data as well as group 
reflection on the digital residua of a life. By 
customizing an area for digital mementos, users can 
develop a space that is representative of a loved 
one’s life, even after they pass away. Before death, 
any editing and memento uploading can be a 
collaborative process. However, all applicable user 
access and editability will be determined at the 
beginning of the process. Users choose a loved one 
to continue customizing a Memento Flori flower, 
effectively transferring their data to specific people, 
with the expectation that the data will continue to 
be protected and expanded upon as memories are 
recalled or new artifacts are found to upload and 
save.  Memento Floris immersive environment sets 
aside a central amphitheater for groups to gather 
and socialize, to remember loved ones and hold 
events in their honor. By interacting with the media 
162
 
and objects users have uploaded, family members 
and friends can reflect on the memories they shared 
and take inventory of their loved one’s digital 
artifacts.  
Limitations 
Most approaches to thanatosensitive design 
have focused primarily on the bereaved rather than 
the dying [79]. Spiritual meaning-making has been 
mentioned as a gap in designing for death and 
bereavement. Finding spiritual meaning within an 
interaction involves “reaffirming sources of spiritual 
energy” and fostering a sense of hope [79]. While 
Memento Floris virtual environment offers unique 
customization in an accessible environment, the 
options to gain spiritual meaning from the memorial 
site depend on how the users engage with it. 
Spirituality is deeply personal. Diving into particular 
effects on spiritual perception is possible if 
researchers choose an introspective approach and 
evaluate their personal experience and growth in 
their faith.  
These design proposals and artwork are a 
broad strokes approach to developing a space and 
product from a thanatosensitive approach. Our aim 
was to design a space that lets users dictate how 
163
 
they would like to process their data while they are 
dying and beyond. The contributions made with 
these design proposals consider grief and dying as a 
universal experience. Accounting for differences in 
collectivistic and individualistic cultures, as well as 
making design choices that allow for a variety of 
religious ceremonies and rituals, are at the heart of 
what Memento Flori is selling – a memorial space for 
every user to make their own. The floral design is 
representative of the flowers brought to headstones, 
as seen in many cultures. Modifications can be made 
to the media layout as needed to accomodate 
personal funeral rituals. This can take the form of a 
simple gallery view; alternatively, media files can be 
arranged as an altar tribute, for those who prefer 
altars.  The virtual memento can be as vibrant or as  
muted as needed, to offer the option to reminisce 
joyfully or to uphold a dignified and serious 
ambiance depending on cultural needs.  Bringing 
groups together can be arranged for collectivist 
families who value large group events to socialize, 
whereas the privacy screen lets individualistic users 
have their moment of solitude.  
Goal 2. 
Preserve memories for future generations 
164
 
To explore opportunities for preserving memories in 
the future, we designed a device that allows families 
to build traditions, whether engaging in community-
based interactions or an individual,  introspective 
experience. To meet the criteria for both collective 
and individual use, group interactions as well as 
single interactions were made possible by using a 
modular, inter-connected design. The DNA-based 
projection will take the form of the user’s memories, 
depicted as an abstract hologram, to portray any 
overlap or shared experiences across generations. 
Reminders of connections to ancestors are made 
possible through the visual representation of 
particles that flow between memory capsules. Users 
have the opportunity to look closely at a memory by 
expanding upon a single particle or watch the web 
of shared experiences flow between family 
members. With a single device, users can watch 
their memories take shape and evolve throughout 
their lifetime. Adding memories is a process that can 
be done at home without a corporate entity 
processing any personal or medical data. With this 
product, users are not required to let Memento Flori 
handle any sensitive information. This is a consumer-
friendly aspect of the personal device, incentivizing 
users to choose Memento Floris memory capsule as 
opposed to other genetic testing companies.  
165
 
Massimi et al. [14] mentioned collaborative 
acts of remembrance as a need for future 
thanatosensitive designs. With the additional 
memory capsule product, Memento Flori offers a 
device that acts as a social connector. Families can 
come together and create a memory capsule chain. 
While the device can be used individually, by 
connecting capsules, the memories will recognize 
shared perspectives and visually reach out to each 
other to make the connection clear. A richer picture 
of a family history can be shown by continuously 
adding memories and connecting capsules from 
each family member, incentivizing a growing 
memory chain for a more detailed generational 
picture. The design included flowing movement 
between capsules when activated, for users to 
experience a visual representation of their 
connection to past generations, or to a loved one 
who recently passed away. When coming together 
to watch the memories unfold as a hologram, 
families can reminisce and share any thoughts or 
emotions elicited by the developing hologram.  By 
offering a device that can be used as a group, as well 
as a personal individual device, individualist and 
collectivist cultures can interact with the device 
according to their needs.  
166
 
The questions that arose while designing the 
memory capsule were centered around the type of 
content that would be reassuring or comforting 
during a time of grief. Human connection cannot be 
replaced by a device, so adding DNA is a way to fully 
incorporate the human factor in a device. 
Speculating far into the future use of a Memento 
Flori memory capsule, cultures that regularly 
exhume their ancestors to celebrate their life could 
collect DNA during the process and view any 
experiences or memories formed during the 
afterlife. 
Limitations 
Developing a reliable mechanism to reaffirm a 
user’s spiritual belief would require investigating a 
user’s particular faith and their reactions to being 
confronted with death and dying, which involves 
emotional and ethical risks. While some cultures 
view exhumation as a common ritual that honors 
ancestors, others view it as a disturbance to the soul 
of the deceased [25], [32], [45]. An individual’s 
religious and cultural bereavement practices create 
boundaries around their participation in certain 
rituals, and as such will determine their reaction to 
Memento Floris DNA-based product. 
167
 
Through the memory capsule product, users 
have a biology-based memento to interact with as a 
group experience or individual commemoration. By 
transforming a loved one’s DNA into a hologram, the 
DNA and its connection to family members can be 
visualized even after the DNA is no longer active or 
viable. Offering users an opportunity to connect with 
their past ancestors over a holographic animation 
may be enough to foster a feeling of hope, that 
following generations will feel the same connection 
to them far into the future. But testing this product 
on a group of potential users should be limited to 
their impressions and the impact of the holographic 
artwork, rather than whether they would use the 
product as an afterlife capsule themselves, to 
protect participants from emotionally damaging 
triggers.  
Goal 3. 
Create emotionally meaningful and personally 
representative AI-generated art 
Our third goal was inspired by the design 
process of the memory capsule. To explore what 
form a generated memory could take, we used AI 
art generators to develop a collection of images 
168
 
inspired by different stages of life. This creation 
process was kept intentionally vague, to see a global 
overview of these life stages in an abstract form, 
allowing room for interpretation. Testing an abstract 
representation made it possible to group visuals 
together by style, resulting in an image progression 
that was visually cohesive. However, despite the 
style constraints in the prompt, literal 
representations of objects and humans were still 
present in some images. In the current state, the 
creation process involves selecting and editing to 
create a group of visuals that are representative of a 
certain stage of life.  
Chatterjee [174] discussed the idea that by 
simply writing an emotion into an AI art model, the 
resulting image will evoke the emotion stated the 
prompt. Since emotion is subjective, the spectrum 
of reactions to an art piece are sure to vary. When 
considering the success of a visual, reframing the 
question into whether the viewer felt moved in a 
certain emotional direction, or whether the 
emotional reaction was expected versus 
unexpected, would be worth evaluating, as opposed 
to whether the intended emotion was accurately 
169
 
evoked. Imbuing AI with emotion will depend on the 
state of the viewer at the time of viewing. 
More personal approaches in AI-aided 
creation rely on personal meaning attached to the 
content of the image. Nunes et al. [2008] described 
the opportunity for rich storytelling based on 
physical mementos that trigger memories. When a 
physical memento is no longer an option, such as 
with long gone ancestors, generative AI can fill in the 
blanks. When creating with my grandfather’s art and 
his portrait, I can create a memory that is relevant to 
him in a time that he never experienced. 
Thanatosensitive creation in art lets the piece take 
on a new meaning, recognizing someone’s absence 
with a physical presence within an image.  
Limitations 
Current AI representations of faces or the 
human form can be off-putting, due to the often 
imbalanced and often incorrect depiction (e.g. 
distorted faces, or seven fingers instead of five). 
Applying an abstract approach to develop visuals 
when they are meant to represent humans can help 
avoid any disturbing or unappealing visuals of a 
loved one. When working with humans as a visual 
subject, using a photographed portrait as a base 
170
 
image can help set the tone for the generative 
creation in order to lessen the potential for 
unwanted changes to the person’s image.  
5.2. 
Implications for Future Memorials 
When probing into culturally sensitive topics 
such as death, previous work has remained in the 
space of arts, design, and cultural theory, to mitigate 
the emotional risks inherent in user studies of this 
nature [77]. Within the limits of introspection and 
artistic creation, taking cultural differences into 
account lets designers develop universal proposals 
that may appeal to a wider range of users.  
Mortality as a motivation for design choices is 
necessary, as most of our lives have been 
transferred to, saved on, and actively influenced by 
personal devices. When devices become intrinsically 
linked to our persona, or even our biology, the data 
becomes undecipherable when later generations 
lack the context that led to the creation of data by 
the original user. Saving and attaching context to 
keepsakes or heirlooms is an important part of the 
memorial process. Whether this curating is done 
throughout life, or after death by loved ones who are 
familiar with the context, it points to a need for 
171
 
thanatosensitive designs with the opportunity to 
expand upon them after death. 
Virtual Environments 
Empathetic Environments 
VR gained more traction as a social setting, 
especially since the COVID-19 pandemic forced 
educational, corporate, and personal meetings 
online [1], [88], [91]. Offering an aesthetically pleasing 
virtual space is important for a comfortable 
environment, but it must also feel secure for users to 
successfully engage socially. Adding safety features, 
such as allowing only designated family members to 
curate or change an aspect of the memorial space, 
is vital to creating a respectful experience. 
Using VR as an immersive space allows for the 
feelings of awe and community to develop. Previous 
applications of VR have shown a decrease in the 
feeling of isolation. Giving users the option to 
engage with their community and to reduce 
loneliness is a crucial aspect of holding a funeral in a 
digital space. Not everyone will want to be socially 
active online, so it is also important to offer the 
choice to be a private participant. Shielding users 
from others by allowing them to go into “anonymous 
172
 
mode” may be useful for protecting identities and 
allowing users to have a private moment to process 
emotions. However, offering anonymity creates an 
issue around communication and transparency 
within a group. Though only verified and trusted 
users will be able to access the material, having a 
person handle sensitive information in private may 
be disconcerting. If a person is struggling with grief, 
and only interacts in private mode, it may be difficult 
for friends and family to recognize their struggle. 
Therefore, the environment itself must act as an 
empathetic party. When, for example, prolonged 
sadness or a sudden increase in visits, are 
recognized, the system should offer an easily 
accessible option to reach out to others. Taking the 
first step in communicating can feel difficult, so the 
options should be unintrusive but available 
immediately. Connecting with friends who are 
already online or having the option to connect with a 
readily available mental health professional could 
offer an added layer of support.  
Perception in VR 
Senses such as smell, or touch, get lost in VR. 
Incorporating natural visuals such as a flower, while 
symbolic of the common offering at headstones, is a 
173
 
reminder of the limitations of the space – the 
fragrance and the delicate texture of the plant are 
not replicable. Tangible representations are 
important in funerals because they give a physical 
representation to what was lost. Incorporating a 
natural look and feel into a digital environment may 
feel disconcerting if not realistically designed. 
In VR, physics-defying features have created 
new opportunities for environmental design. 
Floating, flying, and teleporting are simple and 
resource-efficient methods of transportation in a 
virtual world. Using size as a tool to engage with 
different perspectives in a virtual environment is an 
efficient way to save virtual space and memory. 
Rendering a thumbnail of a media artefact until a 
user chooses to shrink to its level and interact with it 
makes navigating and rendering the space more 
manageable. This Alice in Wonderland-like effect of 
growing and shrinking to match the elements 
around you allows users to continuously add more 
artefacts in an efficient way. 
Preserving Memories 
The act of recalling a memory as a group and 
reviewing unique perspectives is a social experience 
174
 
that is often processed through conversation. 
Reliving shared memories can occur by 
encountering something that triggers a memory, be 
it an object, a sound, or a color. Memento Flori’s 
memory capsule device acts as that trigger, with the 
potential to bring up shared memories across 
generations that have not met in person.  
Bio-based Artwork 
For artwork that relies on human input, the 
viewer simultaneously becomes the art and the 
artist. The symbiotic nature of mutually interactive 
art pieces results in ongoing communication 
between the viewer and the artwork, creating a 
connection that encourages longer engagement. 
Adding DNA to a memory capsule adds a biological 
connection between the viewer and artwork being 
produced. Having loved ones be a part of the input 
results in an authentic visual representation that can 
be identified with the deceased person. 
Memento Flori takes advantage of its diverse 
database by making DNA analysis an attractive 
option for virtual memorials, or for use at home as a 
personal product. Using capsules that only react to 
matching biological DNA when connected offers 
protection against outside input, but it is also a 
175
 
barrier to entry. While some users may prefer the 
option to only include biologically related family 
members to their chain, when spouses come into 
the picture, discussions will arise about how to 
expand the chain, or build a new one. One drawback 
is that Memento Flori is still a company looking to 
profit off its users. If users are estranged from their 
family and want to connect only with their friends 
and loved ones, they will be forced to buy the open-
source product at a higher price.  
Protecting the privacy of a memorial space is 
crucial. If there is a need for a seriously protected 
space, identity verification would keep unwanted 
input away from grieving families and friends. It is 
reasonable to assume that identity verification for 
such places will involve DNA samples, as many 
memorial websites are financially connected to DNA 
analysis companies such as ancestry.com [161]. Our 
work assumes that, in the future, analyzing a DNA 
sample will be enough to create a fully personalized 
artwork, to be displayed at a memorial service. 
Current DNA sample collection happens at home. In 
the future, the technology needed for analysis could 
reasonably be available in users’ homes. Not having 
to rely on companies to uphold data integrity would 
176
 
be of interest to users concerned with privacy. With 
a personal home-based product, users can decide 
whether they would like to keep their interactions 
private or share them with their loved ones. Creating 
an ongoing family memory capsule collection is a 
choice that would appeal to collectivist cultures, 
who value coming together in the interest of the 
group. Individualist cultures may prefer to keep their 
memory capsule separate, connecting to other 
capsules only for special occasions or important 
milestones. Memorial events could include a 
communal ritual in which the last memories of the 
deceased are collected and added to their capsule. 
Families must then decide whether the capsule 
becomes part of an ongoing chain or is kept by a 
trusted family member. 
AI Art Creation as a Journey 
In Memento Flori’s virtual memorial space, 
evoking emotion is possible due to the awe-inducing 
effects of being in an immersive space [139, 140]. 
Emotion is a crucial point in making a meaningful 
memorial experience. To investigate whether AI 
could adjust images to make them emotionally 
intriguing, Chatterjee [174] added the key phrase 
177
 
“evokes the emotion of awe,” to multiple AI art 
generator prompts. By adding Chatterjee’s images 
were created using different art generators. The 
images contained different content and color 
schemes, each supposed to be “awe-inducing” [174]. 
However, they were not evaluated by surveying 
different reactions, so it is unclear whether they had 
the intended effect. Emotions are a nuanced and 
personal experience. Some people may have 
stronger reactions to certain images, while others 
may remain unfazed. 
AI art is inefficient, and users do not speak the 
algorithm’s language – yet. Through keyword trial 
and error and feeding existing art into the prompt, 
users can get close to the artistic vision they have in 
their heads. However, fine-tuning the input until the 
desired result is achieved is tedious. If an artist has a 
specific result in mind, generating pieces over and 
over until the keywords match the artistic 
expectation is an inefficient process. AI generators 
let users create quickly, so it is easy to overproduce. 
The inefficiency of AI art has been criticized by 
many, citing environmental impacts and wasteful 
energy usage [186]. For this project, attempting to 
create a visual of Memento Floris memory capsule 
178
 
using AI was a fruitless endeavor. With a plethora of 
keyword variations, even using some results as base 
images for new generations, the speed and ease of 
creation was impressive; the outcome was not. 46 
images were created in various attempts to describe 
a hexagonal cylinder product made of metal and 
glass (Figure 53). The keywords “hexagonal pattern” 
and “geometrical shape” keywords were included as 
visual guidelines. Out of 46 images, 3 were visually 
interesting, but none of the images met the 
expectation of a product design drawing. At the 
time of creation, a personal estimate was that 
around 20-25 images had been created. The 
simplicity of typing and clicking makes it easy to lose 
track of how many iterations are actually produced. 
Many images end up discarded when they don’t 
match the brief. The process began by focusing on 
the material and shape of the container. Later, 
keywords centered around product advertisement 
and technology design companies were added. The 
iteration process ended with the keyword 
combination: “a long hexagonal cylinder product ad 
futuristic holographic,” created with the Dall-e 2 
generator (Figure 54.)

The Dall-e 2 image, though the fake and non-descript text is 
bothersome, was the closest to the desired outcome (Figure 40). This 
outcome still requires work to be a final image. Retouching the text and 
replacing it with a functional text box, as well as correcting the light and 
shadow placements, could make this a useful template for a product 
advertisement in the end. To compare results, the same keywords were 
entered into a stable diffusion generator (Figure 55). The stable diffusion 
result lacks what makes the Dall-e 2 image successful – the incohesive 
environment around the product and the deconstructed shape do not
 come across like a product advertisement.
181
 
This variability in output foreshadows a long 
road to authentic, personally representative, 
emotion-inducing AI art. AI art generators are 
currently better suited for ideation and inspiration. 
Artists can develop multiple iterations in quick 
succession, which is useful for drafting and 
brainstorming. 
Instead of homing in on a particular visual in a 
specific style, the opportunity to be inspired by 
unexpected results is a benefit that should be at the 
forefront of AI creation. Reframing AI art generators 
as a collaborator, rather than a tool to create can 
offer artists a new perspective. Embarking on a 
creation journey with a machine instead of 
attempting to categorize keyword combinations 
that refer to a specific style seems like a more useful 
approach when working with an imprecise system. 
Creating with AI develops a network of visuals that 
has a central theme. That network gets redirected 
and expanded upon by adding keywords relevant to 
a desired visual style or content meaning. When 
designing towards a specific “destination,” various 
design choices and corrections create forked paths 
that a user can follow or revert to the initial entry 
point. Instead of looking at the result, a finished art 
182
 
piece, AI art creation offers the opportunity to 
evaluate the entire journey necessary to get to that 
destination, if users take each new keyword entry 
into account. 
If we reframe AI generative art to be a 
collaborative endeavor, the implications for future 
work point towards group creation. Users become 
custodians of libraries containing curated input 
terms. Groups could come together to develop a set 
of words representing a loved one, and create art 
based on that list. The personal effort involved has 
the potential to produce a thoughtful, authentic 
piece. Reminiscing by choosing keywords that 
represent a loved one and their memories could be 
a ceremonial moment that offers emotional support. 
In future memorials, this development could be a 
way to bring grieving people together. 
5.3. 
Conclusion & Future Work 
This research contributes an inquiry into the 
importance of personal keepsakes, tangible 
memories, and preserving generational stories in the 
future, in an effort to extend the current state of 
design in the space of future memorials and 
bereavement rituals, specifically in the areas of 
183
 
personal devices and group events in virtual 
environments. With this work, we aim to inspire 
conversations around the questions that arose in the 
process of designing Memento Flori’s memorial 
services, the memory capsule, and applying AI 
models to capture memories of a loved one: 
What rituals will emerge in the future to  
commemorate a loved one who has passed away?
How would you customize your own 
virtual memorial site?
Is an authentic avatar a desirable method to 
preserve a loved one’s traits and mannerisms, or is 
biological matter more important to preserve? 
Can AI-generated art effectively 
evoke authentic emotions? 
What new opportunities for collaboration  
does AI-generated art offer? 
Speculative design requires context for the 
work to come across to a wider audience. Current 
speculative design practices may involve the 
presentation of the imagined futures to a public 
184 
audience to elicit a reaction. A future user-facing 
study could lend insight to the interest level of the  
public to engage Memento Flori’s services. Finding 
out users’ willingness to participate in a virtual 
memorial may reflect the current state of openness 
to immersive settings for social events. However, 
discussions around the quality of the interactions 
should hold more weight when designing 
thanatosensitive environments, due to the unique 
needs that arise due to cultural, personal, and social 
preferences.  
In the future, there could be an immersive 
system that knows its users. Through pattern 
recognition, user logins could be tracked to 
recognize recurring themes, such as birthdays or 
anniversaries, duration between visits, or prolonged 
visits. For emotional events such as a future work 
could investigate how an environment can react to 
users’ needs. Users leave information in immersive 
spaces that could be useful in creating a 
personalized, supportive space for emotional events 
like a memorial. For example, if there is an increase 
in activity, the visitor may be struggling with 
emotions. Tracking how long users stay in 
“anonymous mode,” how often they have reached 
out to their friends, how often they have logged in 
185
 
recently, or facial expressions that suggest sadness  
or fatigue, could allow the system to react with 
appropriate support. Suggestions to connect with 
family members who also knew the deceased 
person, or the option to connect with a mental 
health professional, can be offered in a discreet and 
non-intrusive way. In the interest of transparency, 
users should have to opt into these data points 
before being tracked. These tracking options will 
bring concerns about privacy. Therefore, 
determining how to add them in a reliably secure 
way should be determined prior to implementation. 
The AI-generated lifespan images showcase 
stages of life in an abstract form. The current state of 
the visuals is vague, as they are an initial exploration 
into the development of an AI-generated memory. 
However, it would be worth spending time to 
extrapolate on more specific memory images in 
varying levels of detail, as well as seeing the same 
memory from different perspectives. This artistic 
process could be repeated with a specific person in 
mind, to bring a consistent and clear context to the 
prompt. This could be developed as a purely image-
based project, where attention to style and detail 
can be focused on, rather than the product being 
used to portray the images.  
186
 
Specific emotional reactions and their causes 
in relation to AI art remain to be seen and require 
further study. Future work could include generating 
emotion-evoking art using an AI art generator, and 
then evaluating whether the emotional reaction is 
consistent across different viewers. Though this 
would demonstrate an emotional consistency level, 
qualitative inquiries into personal reactions would 
yield more interesting results due to the personal 
nature of emotional processing. I suggest group 
creation as an artistic practice that allows real-time 
collaboration with individuals using an AI model, 
rather than a one-sided approach to AI creation. 
Using AI to develop memories from different 
perspectives could become a collaborative ritual 
that elicits storytelling and reminiscing.
