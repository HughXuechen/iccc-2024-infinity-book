Abstract
Modern large-scale language models approach the quality of human-level writing. This promises the
advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) writing companions performing AI-led writing under human
control, surpassing traditional writing tools limited to revision and ideation supports. However,
human-AI co-writing may endanger writers’ control, autonomy, and ownership by overstepping
co-creative boundaries.
My research team and I first conducted a design workbook study with 7 hobbyists and 13 pro-
fessional writers and elicited three sets of primary barriers to the adoption of human-AI co-writing.
Storywriters desire retaining control over writing rather than letting AI take the lead when they (1)
prioritize emotional values in turning ideas into words over the productivity of AI-generated writ-
ing; (2) have high self-confidence and distrust AI in challenging sub-tasks (e.g., creating characters
and dialogue); and (3) expect the AI control mechanism to mismatch their writing strategies.
To expand on the results of the design workbook study, I led the design of two AI-assisted writ-
ing tools which support UX scenario writing. I subsequently conducted a summative evaluation
of these systems. Participants prioritized productivity and reacted positively to both systems, per-
ceiving them as Creativity Support Tools (CST)’s for achieving prolific writing. The results reveal
how the tool design interacted with designers’ value structure: both systems allowed them to main-
tain their integrity and enhance their enjoyment. Additionally, increased control promoted a greater
sense of ownership and satisfaction, while adding additional overhead for the designer.
This work lays the groundwork for AI companions that respect storywriters’ personal values
and writing methods.

Lay Summary
AI (artificial intelligence) writing technology is approaching the human level. This opens the pos-
sibility of increasing writers’ productivity by letting the software act like a writing companion that
does the writing while the user focuses on planning the narrative. However, there is a danger that
the AI will not behave like a respectful, helpful collaborator.
To investigate this problem, we interviewed 20 storywriters (7 hobbyists, 13 professionals).
Their reactions to five futuristic AI writing companion designs revealed that some professional
writers prioritize productivity and are happy to let the computer do the writing. By contrast, all
hobbyists and some professionals cherish the emotional value they get from writing and do not
want to hand over writing to an AI.
We then created two AI writing tools for writing stories about interaction with technology.
Testing these with 10 designers showed that the tools successfully supported their personal values.

Introduction
“Building advanced AI is like launching a rocket. The first challenge is to maximize
acceleration, but once it starts picking up speed, you also need to focus on steering.”
— Jaan Tallinn
Language models are approaching human-like text generation capabilities, with large-scale
models like GPT-3 [19] and Jurassic-1 [67] writing natural language at a level which has convinced
some that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has now passed the Turing test. This opens a new opportunity
for human-AI collaboration in writing tasks. This mode of writing support can be referred to as an
AI companion, a co-writing agent which performs storywriting under the creative control of a human
writer. While current AI-based systems act as tools which support grammar and style revision, as
well as ideation, AI companions can directly translate writers’ high-level ideas into fully expanded
text with minimal to zero user input and can adapt to the writer’s style, given only a few examples.
AI companions can therefore take on the role of ”co-creative partners” [44], in addition to acting as
ideation tools. While there are currently no agents which can fully function as an AI collaborator,
this radically different mode of AI writing support promises to be more powerful and autonomous
than existing systems. Hence, the potential impact of such technology must be examined to steer AI
companion design.
Storywriting is a complex task which imposes a high cognitive load on the writer and remains
challenging, even for experienced writers. This task is modeled by the Cognitive Process Theory
of Writing [39] which describes writing as a set of three interleaved processes, namely planning,
translating, and reviewing. In planning, writers synthesize relevant information from their long-
term memory to form ideas, organize these ideas, and set writing goals. Translating is the process
of turning symbolically represented ideas into language which conveys those ideas. Finally, review-
ing involves evaluating the current text against writing goals and revising it based on evaluation
results to match these goals more closely. Writers frequently struggle with frustrating problems in
translating such as writer’s block [92] and cognitive overload [94], hindering efficient writing. AI
1
companions promise robust translating capabilities which can address these challenges, alleviating
the storywriter’s burden, supercharging their abilities, and eventually promoting their intellectual
well-being in creative tasks.
While AI companions promise a powerful form of support to writers, it is unclear how storywrit-
ers perceive AI companion collaboration and which barriers and facilitators influence the adoption
of such technology. Writing is a personal process for many storywriters who have diverse needs,
depending on their underlying motivations. On the one hand, some storywriters see writing purely
as a serious leisure [100] activity allowing for personal expression [65, 90] and supporting emo-
tional well-being [88, 93]. On the other hand, professional writers, such as ghostwriters on gig
platforms, see it as a source of income. However, even professional storywriters derive satisfaction
from engaging in the process of creation [14]. While existing work identifies storywriters’ idiosyn-
cratic priorities, it has not been shown how these priorities impact their expectations for AI writing
support. Therefore, investigating how personal motivations influence storywriters’ requirements for
AI support is of critical importance in informing AI companion design.
Machine assistance in storywriting has largely been limited to a supportive role and has not
come close to realizing the potential of AI collaboration for supporting the translating process.
Current tools primarily focus on supporting revision and ideation. For example, Microsoft Word,
Grammarly, and ProWritingAid are all popular solutions for supporting syntactic and semantic re-
vision (including grammar, spelling, and style checking). Considering ideation, this area has been
explored extensively in creative writing [20, 25, 26, 44, 45, 91, 102]. While there has also been some
focus on translating support in recent years [2, 28, 103, 108], the current work on machine-assisted
storywriting ultimately misses out in investigating writers’ needs for AI-led writing support in the
translating process, revealing a crucial gap.
To go beyond revision and ideation in AI-assisted storywriting, there is a need to determine
how to divide writing responsibilities between the writer and the AI companion and best utilize the
capabilities of both. In general terms, this is a vitally important issue of balancing automation and
control in a human-centered AI system [98]. In this type of mixed-initiative system, understanding
users’ social expectations [50] of the behavior of a collaborator is a key priority, exemplifying the
need to match relevant social norms in AI interaction [1]. Much like a human collaborator, an
AI companion can become an interference to the writer’s creative process if it encroaches on their
boundaries by taking away too much control over writing, creating frustration and conflict.
Broadly, several factors are known to impact people’s acceptance of AI. Individuals’ personality
traits can induce fear and distrust towards AI [82, 99]. Additionally, cultural factors [84] such as fear
of unemployment due to AI deployment [56, 72]), portrayals of AI in popular culture [6, 7], degree
of familiarity with modern AI technologies [86], and expectations of privacy in interaction [70] all
influence perceptions of AI. However, an explorative study on the factors specific to storywriters’
perceptions and practices that might impact on AI is an untrodden pathway.
2
Therefore, this study investigates the following research questions: What primary considera-
tions impact storywriters’ perception of co-writing with an AI companion? And how? Specifically,
we consider: (1) What are the major barriers and facilitators impacting storywriters’ adoption of
different types of AI collaborator support? (2) What value do storywriters expect an AI companion
to bring to, or take away from, their writing practices? and (3) For which kinds of writing sub-
tasks and to what extent are storywriters willing to collaborate with AI companions in the writing
process?
To answer these questions, my research team and I first conducted a formative design workbook
study with 20 expert writers, comprised of 7 hobbyists and 13 professionals (see chapter 3). We
highlighted that co-writing with AI companions promises increased efficiency in expressing writers’
narrative plans with low user effort, alleviating their writing burden. Collectively, our findings
highlight the effects of writers’ emotional values in writing, productivity, trust in AI’s writing ability,
self-confidence, and planning method. Based on these factors, we identified three key sets of barriers
hindering the adoption of AI co-writing. Writers wished to maintain control over translating ideas
to words when they: (1) prioritized emotional values of writing attached to writing over increased
productivity and prolific writing; (2) had high self-confidence and distrust in AI’s ability to perform
challenging writing sub-tasks (e.g., character generation and dialogue generation); and (3) perceived
that the AI control mechanism mismatches their planning strategies. We also revealed two main
facilitators driving storywriters to relinquish control in translating. Writers were willing to let the
AI do the writing when they: (1) emphasized productivity to achieve prolific writing (specifically
professionals) and (2) felt diminished self-confidence about performing challenging writing sub-
tasks.
To validate and build on the results of the design workbook study, I lead the design of two
AI-assisted writing tools for supporting User Experience (UX) scenario writing, which I evaluated
with 10 designers, as described in chapter 4. UX scenario writing is essentially a concise form of
storywriting [71] which provides a good analogue for short creative narratives. The findings reveal
how the values ascribed to writing impact designers in writing scenarios with AI assistance. In gen-
eral, designers prioritized productivity and reacted positively to both tools, being receptive to the
notion of letting the AI translate their ideas into words. I highlight that they perceived both systems
as collaborative design tools allowing them to achieve prolific writing and ultimately increase pro-
ductivity in their design process, without overstepping co-creative boundaries. At the same time,
I describe key differences in how the systems’ control mechanisms impacted designers’ emotional
values.
This work makes the following contributions: (1) Identifying three main barriers and two fa-
cilitators of storywriters’ adoption of AI companions. (2) Characterizing how such barriers and
facilitators are influenced by relevant factors (e.g., writers’ occupation and division of writing sub-
tasks in AI companion design). (3) Generating implications for understanding and designing AI
3
companions in the context of writers’ value structure, writing practices, and intellectual well-being.
(4) Presenting two AI-based prototypes for supporting co-writing in UX scenario writing and the
results of a summative evaluation which show how values ascribed to writing impact writers’ expe-
rience of using these systems.

Background and Related Works
2.1
Factors Influencing Perception of AI
Numerous factors influence humans’ perception of AI. These include psychological factors and
practical concerns within the individual, as well as extraneous cultural influences.
Several individual differences impact perception of AI. First, examining the impact of psycho-
logical factors shows that individuals’ attitude towards AI is influenced by their personality traits
[82]. In [99], it was shown that fear and distrust towards AI are associated with neuroticism, while
openness and agreeableness are related to acceptance of AI. Additionally, personal values have
been shown to impact artists’ attitude towards AI co-creation in creative tasks. For example, [44]
describes how poem writers’ individual sense of ownership impacts their cognitive model of usage
when interacting with an AI collaborator. Another factor impacting users’ attitude is their existing
familiarity with AI technologies, which is associated with increased confidence in AI and reduced
fearfulness of intelligent agents [86]. Finally, for individuals in some professions, fear of being
replaced or losing income is also a major consideration [72]. This can be seen in journalism, where
journalists are concerned that data collection and writing tasks will be replaced by AI [56, 60]. Like-
wise, in [51] radiologists describe a sense of fear that their expertise would become redundant due
to AI, although moderate to advanced knowledge of AI technology was associated with increased
acceptance.
Looking beyond the individual, cultural factors have also been shown to impact humans’ per-
ception of AI. Portrayal of AI in popular culture through movies and other media influences notions
of its capabilities and potential impact [6, 7]. Additionally, social and informational privacy expec-
tations for interaction with human-like AI agents displaying social capabilities (social robots) are
influenced by cultural norms [70]. Results in [84] suggest that users are willing to forego privacy
when they desire a closer connection to the AI.
The existing literature shows the effect of several personal and social factors influencing how
5
people perceive intelligent agents. However, the impact of writers’ personal values in AI-assisted
writing is currently underexplored.

Human-machine co-creation [32, 47, 69, 97] has been explored across many fields in the arts. In
[24], 111 papers on creativity support tools (CSTs) are reviewed. We highlight a few areas where
CST interaction has been evaluated.
Considering writing, recent years have seen significant interest in the formidable task of design-
ing computer-assisted writing tools. In [112], the authors outline the challenges inherent to proto-
typing NLP systems and present several solutions. They explore approaches for supporting writers’
experience of translating ideas to text using sketching and rapid prototyping techniques which en-
able the design of novel NLP-based writing assistance systems, balancing users’ needs with tech-
nical limitations. Looking at tools which have emerged for supporting creative writing specifically,
there has been significant focus on co-ideation support. The tools in [91] and [103] (evaluated in
[20]) allow writers to explicitly request next-sentence suggestions for collaborative brainstorming.
In [45], writers can request random plots, story themes, and writing prompts acting as “story trig-
gers.” By contrast, the collaborative writing support tools in [102] and [26] automatically provide
user-editable, next-sentence suggestions after each sentence the writer produces, providing a source
of inspiration. In [44], the collaborative tool supports metaphor creation based on the writer’s con-
text. Breaking away from suggestion-based co-ideation approaches, visual line sketch interaction
has recently been used as a novel AI steering mechanism for a GPT-based language model in [25],
giving writers an intuitive understanding of the AI’s output and allowing them to control the protag-
onist’s fortune while collaboratively generating a narrative outline. Beyond ideation, tools such as
[103] can provide translating support by offering sentence-level suggestions, although they afford
limited control over suggestion topics and direction, sometimes deviating from the narrative [20].
In [2], the ensemble-based system offers the ability to translate a sequence of story events to full
sentences. The conversational interaction approach in [28] enables users to generate story text via
natural requests (e.g., “help me describe how Taylor is feeling”), while [108] supports dynamic,
text-based video game adventure building. Finally, [64] presents a dataset allowing designers to
explore GPT-3’s capabilities as a writing collaborator.
Besides writing support, in drawing, [33] explores how users collaborate with AI in drawing
pictures via an AI agent called Drawing Apprentice. The system is intended to act as a “casual
creator” [29], which is a type of creative technology that creatively engages users and increase
enjoyment instead of focusing on creating a better end-product. In [80], evaluation of DuetDraw, a
system which allows artists to collaboratively sketch with an AI drawing partner in real time, shows
that artists always want to lead the drawing process and clearly distinguish their role from that of
the AI. Additionally, [77] explores the use of adaptive conceptual guidance via contextual examples
6
to assist novice artists in sketching. Finally, [109] evaluates presents an intelligent tutoring system
teaching novices fundamentals of sketching.
Considering music, creative co-creation can support both composition and performance. In [68],
AI music co-creation is supported via steering tools which enable composition. Creative AI can also
support human-human collaboration in pair composition [101]. Considering musical performance,
[74] presents an AI drummer which communicates its confidence through visual cues to improve
communication in collaborative improvisation, promoting a flow state and building musicians’ trust
in the agent.
A vital aspect of human-AI co-creation is to consider how artists’ existing practices and values
will be considered in design. This will allow the system to adapt to the input of the user to offer a
collaborative experience [34]. Rather than trying to replace the artists in a particular role, the system
should afford task delegation to the AI [80].
2.3
Psychological Ownership and Control
Writers and other creators often feel a sense of ownership over their work which is closely tied
to their control over the creative process. The concept of ownership has been well described in
psychological literature as a relationship between an individual and a target of ownership where
that person feels that the target belongs to them [85, 106]. Ownership is strongly tied to control over
objects which produces positive and pleasurable emotions, both in the case of individual and group
ownership. Objects that can be controlled are seen as objects of ownership, while those outside
of the control of the individual are excluded from this category [40]. Emotional connection is a
key reason individuals value possessions [35]. There is also a sense in which possessions are an
extension of an individual, since possessions reflect and contribute to one’s identity; this aspect of
ownership can be defined as relatedness [8].
Work on psychological ownership has also been extended to the domain of writing. Writers
often have a strong personal connection and a feeling of ownership towards work they produce,
particularly in the case of storywriting, but also in other forms of creative and academic writing
[78]. In fact, Murray [76] goes so far as to say that all writing is in some sense autobiographical,
whether this is explicit or implicit.
2.4
Challenges Facing Writers in Planning and Translation
Writers commonly face challenges in planning and translating. One of these is writer’s block which
can be described as a state in which writers are unable to generate an idea of what to write about next
or to determine how to translate an idea into language [92]. Although some writers are more prone
to suffering from writer’s block than others, this can have a strongly negative emotional impact
on any writer, including emotional numbness, anxiety, and frustration [95]. In [81], the authors
7
propose a set of strategies for addressing writer’s block, including systematic questioning in which
writers are asked a series of questions to stimulate thinking, and freewriting, where the writer writes
uninterrupted for 10-15 minutes to translate as many ideas as possible without performing revision.
Writers also face cognitive overload since writing is a complex, dynamic task in which they must
apply several skills simultaneously [94]. The authors in [105] describe two contributing factors in
human cognitive processing constraints: (1) dual task interference, where writers attempt to perform
two tasks in temporal proximity, thus degrading the performance of both tasks; and (2) the transience
of short-term memory which causes ideas to be lost if the writer is disrupted (e.g., they halt because
they are unsure of what to write next). For mitigating cognitive overload, [55] proposes using
outlining to produce a structured plan which summarizes the writer’s ideas to reduce planning during
translating, while [41] describes using rough drafting to reduce revision effort during translating,
both of which are well-known strategies.

Formative Design Workbook Study
In this study, the objective is to establish writers’ considerations impacting their perception of AI
writing companions. In particular, we aim to understand how the values writers ascribe to writing
influence their willingness to collaborate with AI companions in planning and translating and in
different writing roles within those processes. We also explore how writers’ current storywriting
methods impact their perception of AI co-writing mechanisms and how AI companions can address
their current needs.
3.1
Method
We used the design workbook method [43] to elicit storywriters’ intuition, perception, and reflection
through a set of five speculative AI companion designs. Design workbook is an established method
to elicit user feedback and reflection on conceptual designs within a design space [11, 22, 110]. This
approach effectively alleviates the potential constraints in implementing the design prototype while
enabling participants to envision using the companion in their writing process. The speculative
nature of our workbook facilitated the exploration of key issues and perspectives beyond any one
particular design.
The designs we presented to participants portrayed several modes of interaction with AI com-
panions based on existing writing methods, as detailed in subsection 3.1.3. They illustrate different
divisions of writing roles between the human and the AI co-writer in planning and translating. This
allowed us to uncover the considerations which impact storywriters’ perception of AI support in
different writing processes. It also provided insight into the extent to which writers are willing to
collaborate with AI companions in various writing sub-tasks. Finally, participants’ reactions offered
glimpses into the perceived value AI-assisted writing would add to different parts of the writing pro-
cess and highlighted where AI companions can disrupt the writer.

Participants
We used purposive and snowball sampling to recruit 20 storywriters (13 women, 7 men), including
7 hobbyists (H1-H7) and 13 professionals (P1-P13). Our study included both types of writers since
we suspected that writers with different underlying motivations for writing would have different per-
ceptions of AI companions. See Table 3.1 for information about participant demographics, writing
approach, and writing experience. Hobbyist writers were recruited through social media platforms
(e.g., Reddit threads and Facebook groups) and by disseminating recruitment information in local
hobbyist writing circles, while we reached out to professional writers through the Upwork.com1
gig working platform. All recruited professional writers do writing work via Upwork, although
they also engage in paid writing outside the platform. We aimed to include writers from different
domains of storywriting: short stories, flash fiction, novels, game stories, memoirs, poetry, news
articles, promotional material (copywriting), and technical material. All writers except P7 reported

an intermediate level of technological aptitude or better, and at least an intermediate writing tool
aptitude in using word-processors and similar technology. Our participants resided on 4 continents:
Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. Participant ages ranged from 21 to 55 (median 39).
We recruited the two main groups of writers using slightly different sets of criteria. For hobbyist
writers, we selected participants with at least one year of experience. In the case of professionals,
we recruited writers with at least two years of experience and an Upwork.com project success rate
of 90% or greater. We set these criteria to ensure participants were not novice writers. We used the
criterion of two years for professionals since this is how long it generally takes for this kind of writer
to become established. All participants were fluent in English. Writers were paid an honorarium for
participation. The institution’s research ethics board has approved the protocol.
3.1.2
Interview Methodology
This study used semi-structured interviews which included questions and a design workbook feed-
back component. Our interviews used open-ended questions focusing on participants’ current prac-
tices and the challenges they face. (See appendix A.1 for the full interview questions and detailed
procedure.) The design workbook component provided participants an opportunity to explore a set
of design concepts based on several models for AI writing companions and offer their insights. Our
methodology is also partly inspired by the Speed Dating approach [31, 113] where participants com-
pare potential scenarios of use for an envisioned system to help assess their current needs and ways
to address them. It also allows designers to surface critical design issues and it ultimately provides
insight into the underlying factors influencing users’ perceptions. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
our interview process is simplified with designs presented in an electronic slideshow format rather
than a physical booklet, similar to [22]. All interviews were conducted through Zoom web confer-
encing software. The AI companion designs and details of the protocol were refined through five
pilots which were conducted with five graduate and undergraduate computer science students who
are familiar with interaction design techniques.
Our design workbook contains several static pages (slides) which allowed us to simulate usage
scenarios for each design concept by displaying pages to participants in order. This explorative
approach suits our objectives better than an interactive evaluation, for two main reasons. First, an
interactive system would constrain participants to the current limitations of generative language
models. We would like to go beyond the current state-of-the-art and explore speculative scenarios
where AI companions can perform writing roles at a human level. We wanted our participants to
focus on different human-AI co-writing mechanisms and how they fit to their own writing practices.
Showing ”live” results could draw the participants’ attention to the specific defects in the selected
language model or flaws in technical implementations, like latency or UI details. For example, we
found that GPT-3 has a highly irregular latency for requests, which sometimes exceeds 30 seconds.
This delay may cause a significant disruption to the interview process. Therefore, we used tex-
11
tual examples from existing stories which we extended, where needed, to show different simulated
AI companion responses. Second, it would be infeasible to implement and evaluate five different
types of AI writing companions to support an interactive design probe. Using low-cost interactive
methods such as Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) [30] is not practical since it is not possible for the wizard
to write simulated AI-generated text in a reasonable time (a few seconds), particularly when long
text is required. Furthermore, it would be labor intensive for participants to write a story using each
prototype.
The data collection process had two main components: a background screening survey and a
semi-structured interview which incorporates a design workbook session. Construction of the de-
sign workbook is discussed further in subsection 3.1.3. Our screening survey recorded information
on participant demographics, general technological skill level, and aptitude in using writing soft-
ware. It also probed each potential participant’s years of writing experience and the type (genre) of
writing they had experienced. The interview sessions lasted for approximately 60 minutes and were
conducted by the lead author. Participants were audio and video recorded while the interviewer took
notes. Our interviews consisted of three main components: (1) introductory questions about par-
ticipants’ background and writing practices, (2) the design workbook session, and (3) a debriefing
interview exploring writers’ values ascribed to the writing process. The interviews started with an
introduction where the interviewer explained the procedure to participants and asked participants
questions about their: (1) genre of writing, (2) primary motivations and goals in storywriting, (3)
primary challenges encountered in the writing process, (4) current and past use of AI-assisted writ-
ing tools, and (5) current practices for their planning and translating processes. During the design
workbook session, participants viewed the designs and gave feedback. For each design, the inter-
viewer explained the design concept and presented the corresponding pages to illustrate a scenario
where an AI companion based on the current design would assist the user in a writing task to address
a particular need. After each design concept, the interviewer asked questions to elicit a response
and initiate a conversation framed around the role(s) the AI companion would take on. Participants
were encouraged to elaborate on the scenarios to describe how they would fit into their current
workflow. Additionally, the interviewer asked probing questions as the conversation developed, to
form an understanding of the writer’s values in writing and of how writers envisioned aspects of the
given AI companion would impact their current writing practices. In the debriefing interview, the
interviewer asked follow-up questions based on participant feedback during the design workbook
session. Participants were asked to rank the designs according to perceived applicability and support
in their current writing tasks (rankings are included in appendix A.1).2 The interviewer then asked
participants to justify their ranking, establishing the factors impacting their preferences. Finally,
writers answered follow-up questions further exploring their value perceptions in writing.
2The ranking data was collected to set the stage of the conversation about their perception about types of AI writers,
not to evaluate the perceived quality of the designs.

3.1.3
Creating the Design Workbook
We constructed our design workbook to effectively convey five main conceptual models describing
how the writer would interact with AI companions. Our design space describes these diverse types
of AI companions in terms of the division of control between the human and the AI co-writer in
different planning and translating tasks across the writing process, which is outlined in Figure 3.1.
Note that the designs are intended to elicit reactions from participants to help answer our research
questions and do not in themselves aim to offer a design contribution.
Our designs are grounded in existing writing methods (e.g., character-driven writing, the Snowflake
method [52]). We adapted these methods to incorporate AI companions. Additionally, we were
guided by conceptual underpinnings of AI writing support - level of control and different writing
sub-tasks, as described in [39]. We strove to ideate diverse AI types which span these two di-
mensions. This is discussed in more detail for each design in this subsection. First, the authors
conducted a review of existing writing methods. We then met weekly for three weeks (approx. 3
hours in total) to discuss and brainstorm potential designs based on writing methods identified by
the lead author. In brainstorming, our research questions acted as a starting point and anchor. While
we incorporated several writing methods, we did not include those which could not be adapted to
AI co-writing. We also merged or discarded design ideas which were deemed to be too similar and
discarded those which were not applicable for supporting planning and/or translating. The designs
were then rapidly created using presentation software prior to the pilots. We ultimately developed
five designs with five corresponding underlying interaction models. Therefore, we named the de-
signs accordingly and ordered them, with the most traditional (“status quo”) approaches appearing
13
first and more unconventional or controversial designs shown later. Following each pilot interview
session, we iteratively refined these designs based on feedback received. This allowed us to stream-
line our designs by resolving aspects which were confusing or distracted from the intended concept
being conveyed. The design “workbook” is included in appendix A.1. Samples of these designs are
included below in each of the corresponding sections. Each snapshot has been annotated for clarity.
Design 1: Linear approach
Linear writing aims to address writer’s block and support co-ideation with unguided suggestions.
Suggestions are unguided in the sense that the user cannot direct the system’s focus to a certain
aspect of the text or describe the intended narrative direction. Thus, the “best” suggestions are
generated based purely on the previous text. Writers have some additional control in that they can
specify the number of sentences they receive in each suggestion and access previous suggestions in
the suggestion history. The division of writing roles is summarized in figure 3.2 and a snapshot of
the design can be seen in figure 3.3.

Therefore, the suggestion-based approach has a similar design to existing predictive text solutions
such as [103] where users receive a potential completion based on their existing text. The AI com-
panion provides a set of suggestions for the next sentence(s) which are intended to fit the current
context of the writer’s narrative.
Design 2: Keyword-based approach
In this design, the AI companion generates guided contextual suggestions directed by the writer’s
idea for the next narrative event. This approach builds upon Design 1: Linear approach, which has
the same division of writing roles (see figure 3.4). In this design, the aim is to mitigate blocking
and provide ideation assistance while giving writers greater control over suggestions. Users specify
a high-level description of the next event and a set of keywords which help guide the AI’s focus
towards specific themes within the main text (see figure 3.5). In creating this design, we aimed to
build on writers’ practice of sketching a rough description of narrative events in brackets within the
text or in the margins when they are unsure of how to express the that event in full [95]. We also
drew inspiration from [26] where keywords are used to develop slogans.

Design 3: Scene-based approach
In scene-based writing, the AI companion affords low-effort translating support while writers fo-
cus on top-down narrative planning based on the different scenes within the story (see figure 3.6).
Writers first provide the story theme and setting, as well as an early synopsis of the narrative they
envision, as depicted in. They then create a scene list and specify the motivating factors which are
driving the events in each scene, as depicted in figure 3.7. These motivating factors are plot facts
which shape the characters’ motivations in each scene. The AI companion subsequently generates
the story text for each scene to create a full first draft of the story. To support refinement, writers can

scene text is then updated accordingly. This design is inspired by the Snowflake method of writing

Design 4: Character-driven approach
The character-driven approach allows writers to rapidly generate characters at any stage of story-
writing. It is inspired by the character-driven writing method which is commonly used to write
stories centered around character building and characters’ relationships [9, 37]. For example, this
approach is used in writing video game stories [59]. Writers start with ideas about characters and
then develop the character arc and properties of each character. We envision a scenario where the
writer provides the system with a description of the properties of each character, which includes
16
the character’s physical appearance, role, personality, flaws, and strengths, as well as their goals and
challenges. Writers also provide a description of the relationships between characters in a character-
web format, as shown in figure 3.9. The AI companion then generates a set of character arcs based
on the character descriptions and relationships between characters. See the division of labor sum-
marized in figure 3.8. These describe potential scenarios of how the character develops across the
story.

Design 5: Conversation-driven approach
The final approach focuses on supporting the writer in developing dialogue among characters and
aims to provide natural, context-aware dialogue generation which reflects characters’ attributes.
This design may be used for writing dialogue directly, ideating about character development, or
developing narrative events involving particular characters. It is inspired by collaborative text-
17
based roleplaying where writers attempt to imagine themselves as a particular character and talk
to characters in their story. This activity is supported in online roleplaying communities such as
Forum Roleplay [107]. We envisage that the writer can choose two or more characters involved
in a conversation and define the conversation context. The writer then takes on the role of one
character who initiates a conversation with the other character(s) via a chat-like interaction (see
figure 3.11) where the writer is in control of directing the conversation. They are then responsible
for translating the narrative, as outlined in figure 3.10. If they desire, the writer may take on the
role of different characters throughout the conversation. The output of the chat can then be used as
inspiration (similar to [58]) or as dialogue in the story, which the writer may edit as they desire.

Analysis
All audio from the video recordings was fully transcribed prior to analysis. We performed a reflex-
ive thematic analysis [16] since this is a rigorous process which was adaptable to our needs. We
applied both inductive and deductive analysis methods. We inductively developed codes through
open coding and iteratively refined existing codes by comparing them to the interview transcripts.
These codes were then grouped into categories based on commonalities between them. Addition-
ally, we deductively grouped codes into categories based on AI companion designs, known writing
approaches, writing processes, and related concepts. We then used the relationships between cate-
gories to develop a set of themes which relate deductive and inductive categories. Ultimately, we
created 112 codes and 18 main themes, such as: ”Storywriters’ self-assessed skill in performing
writing tasks impacts their willingness to give up control over specific parts of the writing process”
and ”‘Labor of love’: storywriters are concerned that AI companions which dominate in translat-
ing will take away from the joy and pride of writing.” Throughout this process, the three authors
met virtually every week for 4 months to discuss the codes and developing themes. We continued
conducting interviews until thematic saturation was reached. We continuously checked the appro-
priateness of the developed themes against our research questions, as recommended in [17]. Based
on these discussions, the lead author wrote several memos which eventually developed into the key
insights in our findings.
3.2
Findings
We found that storywriters’ perception of AI support is strongly influenced by emotional values they
attribute to writing, their desire for productivity, trust in AI and self-confidence, and their planning
method. Our findings highlight how these considerations impact the type and extent of AI support
which writers desire. See Table 3.2 which summarizes these findings. We relate our results to the
AI companion design space depicted in Figure 3.1.
When illustrating their perceptions towards AI, storywriters grounded such descriptions on com-
mon challenges in their current writing workflow which echo previous work, including high effort
and cognitive overload in translating [39, 94] and writer’s block in planning [4, 12, 79, 92]. Cur-
rently, many participants frequently apply writing assistance tools (e.g., Grammarly) to aid in auto-
checking spelling, grammar, and style, where these tools provide satisfactory support for spelling
and grammar revision, although they sometimes cause frustration by failing to capture the user’s
intent and personal writing style.
3.2.1
Emotional Values of Writing and Productivity
One unique strength of modern large-scale language models in writing is their capacity for the trans-
lating task, namely the process of turning ideas into words [39]. The primary pattern identified in
19
Table 3.2: Five major barriers and facilitators impacting the desire to adopt AI companions
are grouped into three types. The impacted writing process in column 4 describes the
major area(s) of writing wherein each consideration influences writers’ perceptions. Sub-
tasks within each process are specified, where relevant.

ion support.
Barrier
Planning
our analysis is the way writers’ personal values shape their desire to take (or relinquish) control over
the translating process. We group these values into two sets. Some storywriters, mostly hobbyists,
tend to desire greater control in translating their ideas to text and would not like to let an AI com-
panion do the writing. These writers prioritize their fulfillment, ownership, and integrity, which we
collectively refer to as the emotional values of writing. By contrast, professional storywriters who
desire greater productivity in producing writing deliverables are willing to give up control and are
receptive to the notion of letting the AI take the lead in translating while they focus on high-level
planning.
”Labor of love”: storywriters who emphasize the emotional values of writing expect direct
control over the translating process, diminishing the AI companion to an ideation tool.
Work on AI co-creation such as [80] has revealed that artists would like to retain creative control
while delegating tedious tasks to AI agents. This suggests that writers might prefer to have control
20
over planning while delegating manual tasks in translating to the AI companion. On the contrary, we
found that some writers do not want to let the AI lead the translating process. A key reason for this
hesitation is that these writers emphasize the emotional values of writing. This seems counterintu-
itive, since the process of expressing ideas is often arduous and restricts writers’ focus on planning
(e.g., plot generation and character generation). Indeed, several writers described translating as the
most tedious part of the overall writing process (H1, P2, P5, H5, P9), with P9 calling it “the grind
of turning out chapters.” However, we found that storywriters prioritizing the emotional values of
writing see their engagement in this process as a “labor of love.” We show how these writers’ values
drive them to reject AI-led support in translating, even when it promises to relieve their writing
burden.
Some writers want control over translating because they find fulfillment in writing by closely
engaging in the process of expressing their ideas. This tendency was particularly prevalent in hob-
byist writers, none of whom wanted to miss out on the joy of turning ideas into words. For example,
H2 clearly describes that they would not continue a story if they did not enjoy writing it, saying:
“It’s a labor of love, not a labor of hate [...] if you look at your piece of work and
you’re [. . . ] just hating yourself and going into depressionville it’s like [...] the piece
is done, just throw it away.”
For H2 and other hobbyist writers, the act of writing goes beyond completing a task. They attach
personal feelings to the writing activity and do not want to engage in a writing project which does
not provide them enjoyment (“the piece is done, just throw it away”). Rather, they see writing as a
difficult task which should provide enjoyment (“labor of love”). Expanding on this theme, we saw
that writers who are motivated by emotional values achieve pleasure by persevering in the writing
process. P3 expressed that “the pleasure of writing is tearing [the language] from your mind, as
hard as that can be sometimes.” They derive pleasure from engaging in the difficult or even painful
task of finding the best way to express their ideas as words (“tearing [the language] from your
own mind”). Writers like them value the fulfillment they achieve by being actively involved in the
process of translating their ideas to words, even though it can be arduous. In response to Design 3:
Scene-based approach, H3 went on to say that such AI-led writing “would not be very satisfying”
since they would not like “the text written for [them].” Thus, they emphasize that they would not
achieve satisfaction if the AI companion did the writing.
Our analysis also revealed that some storywriters desire to control the process of expressing
their ideas in stories since they want to establish a sense of ownership over their writing. Not only
do these writers want to feel that the story ideas are their own, but they also want to feel that the end
product belongs to them by actively engaging in the process of translating. P3 described ownership
as a key motivation for controlling various aspects of the writing process:
“[. . . ] it’s a combination of the plot, characters and the language style [...] that
21
makes you feel like you have control over [the writing process...I] want [the story] to
be my own so I want it to take place where I want it, and for [the characters] to talk
how I want it.”
Writers like them want the story to “be [their] own” and a key way they accomplish this is by
controlling the “language style” in translating. In particular, they would like the characters’ speech
to reflect their intended style of dialogue (“talk how [they] want it”). Additionally, they want to
control the generation of “plot and characters” in planning, particularly the story setting (“take
place where I want it”). Moreover, H4 described why they would dislike an AI-led approach as in
Design 3: Scene-based approach which takes over the translating process, saying: “I don’t want to
feel like someone else is doing my work [...] I don’t want to be the editor of my piece, I want to
be the writer of my piece.” Here they express their sentiment that this type of AI companion would
overstep the boundaries of a collaborator and make them feel that another writer is “doing [their]
work.” They would then no longer feel that they command the language and that the writing product
(“[their] piece”) belongs to them, but rather that they are relegated to only being “the editor.”
We found that storywriters who prefer AI companions which allow the writer to lead the writing
process are driven by a desire to maintain a sense of their personal writing identity. Indeed, these
writers saw writing as a deeply personal product. Writers like H3 feel that their writing style is as
integral to them as their fingerprint, who reacted to Design 3: Scene-based approach as follows:
“[Just as] we all as humans have distinctive fingerprints, we have distinctive writing
styles [. . . ] I would not want my fingerprint of writing destroyed by letting someone
else do it [. . . ] it’s important: picking that vocabulary, picking how the character should
speak, and how characters should not speak like one another.”
They would like to control the language style (“picking that vocabulary”), particularly the character
dialogue (“picking how the character should speak”). H3 relates this control to their personal writing
identity (“fingerprint of writing”). By allowing an AI to lead the writing (“letting someone else do
it”) and not engaging in applying their personal language style, they feel that their identity would
not be reflected in the end product and that their “fingerprint of writing” would be destroyed.
Finally, some storywriters would like to command the writing process as this allows them to
maintain a sense of integrity and pride in their writing. They felt that sacrificing control over trans-
lating to increase efficiency would threaten their integrity. Specifically, these writers were concerned
that letting the AI do the writing would be dishonorable and that it would feel like cheating. They
felt it would be dishonest to use generated content in the final product rather than merely utilizing
it as a source of inspiration. H4 exemplifies this attitude in response to Design 3: Scene-based
approach, indicating that ”it just feels like you’re cheating. [If] you got stuck you’re just gonna
hit this button [[. . . ]and] it’ll fill it all rather than give you ideas.” Here, H4 expresses that creating
an entire draft (“fill it all”) with the scene-based AI companion (“hit this button”) after creating an
22
outline would make them feel that they are being dishonest (”cheating”). Additionally, some partici-
pants expressed concerns that using an AI companion to do the writing may damage their reputation
if their audience realizes they are utilizing AI-generated text. They considered publishing stories
containing AI-generated text to be dishonorable and felt that they would be ”called out by [their]
readers and by [their] conscience” (P7) for using an AI companion. Here, P7 alludes to their fear
that readers will react negatively (“call [them] out”) if they discover the story text was written by
AI, even in part. The writer is also concerned that they would damage their own sense of honor
(“called out by their conscience”) if they let an AI collaborator do the writing.
In contrast to translating support, all storywriters are receptive to leveraging AI companion for
co-ideation in plot and character generation since it is not perceived as a threat to their creative con-
trol. For instance, writers like H4 who do not want to give up ownership favor using AI companions
for ideation support over translating. H4 expressed this attitude:
“I want to feel ownership over the project in general, but I feel like I’d be much
more open to collaboration about the ideas and building things rather than the actual
words [. . . ] I would rather collaborate with the AI to build a character or build a plot
and build these things, than actually have it write things for me.”
Here, H4 expresses that collaboratively generating ideas about characters and plot (“build a char-
acter or build a plot”) does not threaten their ownership of the writing product, while “havi[ing]
the AI write things for [them]” would make them feel that they lose control and ownership over
the project. These agents are expected to provide collaborative support which augments existing
ideation practices and supports different parts of writing to overcome blocking.
Participants felt that the types of ideation support afforded by AI companions would build on
their current practices for developing story narratives and characters and help break through writer’s
block. Several writers described facing writer’s block (H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, P2, P5, P8).
They described resorting to the following ideation methods which help overcome this challenge:
subconscious ideation while performing an unrelated activity (H2, P1, P2, P7), writing prompts
from online sources (e.g., Reddit r/WritingPrompts community3) (H2, H3, H4, H6, P11), inspiration
from other literary works and other media (H2, H3, H7, P2, P3, P5, P6, P9), collaborating with
colleagues and members of their social circle (H1, P4, P8, P10, P11), and conversation roleplaying
(H3, H7, P11, P12).
Using AI companions as an ideation mechanism was perceived as an excellent support for plot
and character generation by providing serendipitous writing insights shedding light on unthought as-
pects of story narratives, character arcs, and conversations. First, participants perceived suggestion-
based approaches to be helpful in creating brainstorming prompts for plot generation (H1, H5,
P2, P3, P6, P7, P10, P11). Unguided suggestions in Design 1: Linear approach provide inspiration

from cold start. Participants like H1 felt that suggestions that were “totally random and unexpected”
could “give [the writer] ideas of where to go” when they are unsure of the narrative direction. By
contrast, guided suggestions in the Design 2: Keyword-based approach support controlled ideation
based on the writer’s foreknowledge of next events in the story (H1, H5, P2, P6, P10). H1 describes
the value of being able to direct suggestions to match narrative direction when developing ideas,
expressing that ”when writing about a specific theme it can keep your story going in that direction
[. . . ] I could see that being quite useful and it could help generate ideas [about that topic].” Looking
next at character generation, some participants expressed that Design 4: Character-driven approach
can provide a “fresh perspective,” much like an external human collaborator which gives a writer
new insight into how a character can evolve (P7). This design was also seen as being effective in
creating initial characters (P11) and adding characters further in the writing process (P6). Addi-
tionally, several storywriters also indicated that the Design 5: Conversation-driven approach would
offer an opportunity for understanding characters better by supporting a conversation roleplaying
ideation method. For example, H3 indicated that this approach would help them to add depth to
characters, saying:
”The characters need to be 3D and you almost have conversations with them [char-
acters] in your head while you’re writing [...] having
something like this to just give you a prompt, I would love it since it would let me do
that [conversation roleplaying].”
H3 refers to adding depth to characters [“be 3D”] and describes how this design would fit with their
existing ideation practice of conversation roleplaying (“have conversations with them [characters]
in your head”). Finally, considering ideation in dialogue development, some writers (H1, H3, P12)
described that they would use conversation generation as a source of inspiration for advancing con-
versations. P12 indicated that conversing with the AI companion would elicit novel conversation
directions: “It would be helpful in [. ..] giving me an idea, and I might do it [converse with the
AI] a couple [of] times to get a few lines and then I’m ready to go, and I’ve got an idea of where
I’m heading.” After conversing with the AI to generate “a few lines” of dialogue they envisioned
that they would develop an idea of the direction of the conversation (“an idea of where [they are]
heading”).
Professional storywriters who prioritize productivity are willing to give away control in
translating, envisioning AI companions as writing collaborators.
Our analysis revealed that some professional writers are receptive to the notion of letting the AI take
the lead in writing and are willing to relinquish control to increase their productivity by collaborating
with the AI. This is because these professionals prioritize productivity over the emotional values of
writing to achieve financial gain. Thus, this finding expands on existing research investigating other
24
domains of work with output-based compensation which has demonstrated that increased income is
a key incentive driving worker productivity [3, 13, 61, 62, 96].
Storywriters prioritizing productivity felt that AI-led writing would reduce the effort required in
expressing their ideas, thus reducing their workload. Writing the first draft and “getting the words
onto the page” (P5) is often challenging and labor-intensive. For instance, P2 described how they
would like to use an AI companion based on Design 3: Scene-based approach to provide translating
support in this task.
”It [the AI companion] would take out the busy work of writing out the details
[. . . ] of what happens in a scene. This would definitely save a lot of time [in the first
draft. . . ]”
They envisioned that AI-led writing would improve productivity by alleviating their burden in the
tedious process of writing each scene (“busy work of writing out the details”) for the first time
when confronted with a blank page. Some writers (P2, P4, P5, P8) hoped that this form of AI-led
writing would allow them to deliver writing products to clients more quickly, decreasing the stress
of meeting deadlines.
A key reason why writers who prioritize productivity do so is that they see writing as a job for
financial gain. While this was not the case for all professionals, 6 of the 13 professional writers
(P2, P4, P5, P8, P10, P13) we interviewed showed this tendency, all of whom are gig workers on
Upwork.com. For example, P8 “takes on a high volume of work” and “needs the writing process
to [be] efficient” to meet their clients’ time constraints. They went on to describe generating an
income as their main motivation for writing:
“I work 100% as a ghostwriter [...] it is a business for me [...] it is my living [...]
I entered it [writing] as a business [to] pay the bills.”
This reveals how writers like them are primarily motivated to write so that they can increase their
income to support their livelihood (“it is my living”) and meet financial obligations (”pay the bills”).
Writers who were receptive to AI-led writing support saw AI companions which assisted in the
translating process as writing partners which would augment their own writing ability. This goes
beyond what is expected of writing support tools. For instance, P13 described co-writing with an
AI companion as follows:
”It would be really a partnership [...] an AI like this would be partnering with me
to make me better at what I’m doing, [better than what] I can do on my own, [and to]
make [writing] more efficient, so that I can speed up my process and be able to deliver
the end goal at a quicker rate.”
They describe how this ”partnership” would allow them to improve their writing ability (”partnering
with me to make me better at what I’m doing”), much like collaborating with another writer. Addi-
tionally, they expect that the AI co-writer will allow them to surpass the level of writing efficiency
25
they could achieve on their own (”[better than] what I can do on my own [and to] make [writing]
more efficient. . . ”).
Likewise, P4 indicated that a scene-based AI companion would be helpful in developing a story
from an outline. However, they would also like to establish a sense of ownership over the generated
content:
”I think it definitely would help because sometimes even when you have an outline
[. . . ] it can be difficult to figure out what do I do with it? How do I make it interesting;
how do I make it really fill out the rest of text? So having at least a starter [when]
writing scenes could definitely help out [...] I’d probably take the content that it has
generated and then [. . . ] put a little of my own spin on it, or [...] maybe reword things
[. . . ] add, or edit.”
Here, P4 describes the challenge of writing the first draft from an outline (“once you have outline,
it can be difficult to figure out what do I do with it”). They envision that the AI companion would
reduce their writing burden by giving them a first draft as a starting point (“a starter”). However,
they would like to establish their writing identity and ownership in this process (“put a little of
[their] own spin on it”) by exercising control over the writing style by modifying the generated
content (“reword things [. . . ] add, or edit”).
Participants’ reactions to AI companions which dominate in translating ultimately reveal that
all writers aspire to have some degree of control over expressing their ideas. Even those valuing
productivity most highly wanted to have some control because they want to form a sense of own-
ership and have the writing reflect their identity. Therefore, what we see is not a dichotomy, but
different shades of ways that writers assign value to their writing practices. We have highlighted the
corresponding differences in the type and degree of control storywriters seek in translating.
3.2.2
Trust in AI Companions and Self-confidence
Our storywriters reported having varying degrees of trust in AI companions and in their own writing
abilities in specific writing tasks (e.g., generating characters). In contrast to the personal values
ascribed to writing, trust and self-confidence impact writers’ perception of AI support at the more
fine-grained level of specific writing sub-tasks within high level processes such as planning. We
highlight how trust and self-confidence influence storywriters’ acceptance of AI companions in
different writing roles.
Distrust in AI companions’ capabilities leads storywriters to desire control over roles requiring
commonsense reasoning, such as character generation.
Participants understood the notion of an AI companion and discussed their perception of AI writers’
high-level writing capabilities, going far beyond what can be commonly expected from writing sup-
26
port tools (e.g., grammar checking, style transfer, etc.) and including (1) Capturing the background
and attributes of characters in character generation, (2) reflecting personality and the current narra-
tive context in translating dialogue, and (3) incorporating the interplay between events in translating
narration in scene descriptions.
Looking first at character generation, some writers expected AI companions to be ineffective
in this area since they distrusted the AI’s capabilities to grasp the contextual, nuanced aspects of
characters. Specifically, they felt that an AI companion modelled after Design 4: Character-driven
approach would not effectively capture characters’ complex goals and personality (H7, P2, P5,
P6, P9). Since character development is a complex process, there was a perception that an AI
companion would find it challenging to grasp all the attributes of a character based only on the
writer’s character outline. We found that the cause of this distrust is a perception that the AI would
lack intuition. The participants’ expectation matches tests showing that generative language models
like GPT-3 sometimes show a lack of commonsense reasoning [73]. Writers felt that this type
of reasoning is required to accurately interpret their description of the characters by relating their
goals and personality to the wider narrative context. For example, P2 expressed doubt whether the
AI would be able to understand the writer’s intention in describing character attributes:
“Can it [the AI] really understand a character’s goals [the writer] stated so that they
connect to the story [. . . ] and [can the AI understand] the disposition of the character
[. . . ] ? A writer might say, ‘oh he’s a happy-go-lucky guy.’ What does that really
mean? Does that mean, he is a positive person? Or [does it mean] he is self destructive
in a way that he ignores problems?”
Here, they describe their distrust in character generation. First, they feel that the AI may not un-
derstand the writer’s description of characters’ goals and would not be able to relate them to the
rest of the story (“connect to the story”). They also use the ambiguous term ”happy-go-lucky” as
an example of a personality description (“disposition of the character”) which can only be resolved
by having an intuitive understanding of the character and their background within the context of the
story.
Some writers were hesitant to accept AI support in translating dialogue because of distrust in
the AI companion’s capabilities to capture the narrative context and portray characters’ emotions.
They felt that AI companions would not be able to create compelling dialogue. Specifically, they
did not trust that an AI companion design based on Design 5: Conversation-driven approach would
achieve the natural colloquialism of a conversation, being overly perfect in grammar and formal in
style. While technically “correct,” this style of language would not match the reader’s expectation
of a natural conversation within the characters’ current context. They perceived dialogue to be one
of the most challenging parts of writing and felt it would be difficult for an AI to achieve something
which is already demanding for a human writer (P7, P9, P10). P7 expressed this concern by saying:
27
“We were taught to write a certain way [...] using complete sentences with a
sentence and a verb and preposition. Everything has to be grammatically correct. And
I’m afraid that AI would pick up on that [...] it would be very structured and very
proper and that’s not how we speak in real life [...] artificial intelligence [...] would
have a really hard time making it sound natural.”
Here, they describe a prescriptive and grammatically correct form of writing taught to beginners
(“everything has to be grammatically correct”) which is “structured and very proper” but does not
match the way humans typically converse (“not how we speak in real life”). Several participants
also felt that the AI would not be able to match the scene context and intended narrative direction
when generating dialogue (P2, P6, P7, P9, P10, H6). P9 indicated they would not trust the AI to
create context-aware dialogue:
“It would be a struggle [for the AI to convey] the information that you want to get
into the scene to move the plot forward with what the character would actually say in
that situation [. . . ] I think you[. ..]have to be a good writer to do dialogue so that could
be quite a challenge for the AI.”
Writers like P9 indicated that they felt that dialogue writing demands significant skill for writers
(“you have to be a good writer to do dialogue”). When comparing the perceived capabilities of an
AI writer to human writers, they felt that the AI would not measure up to an experienced writer.
Therefore, they are concerned that the generated dialogue might diverge substantially from the
narrative context (“what the character would actually say in that situation”) and would not match
the writer’s idea for advancing the narrative (“move the plot forward”).
Finally, some writers expressed scepticism about the ability of the scene-based AI companion
to perform complex scene writing as they did not trust that the AI would have an intuitive under-
standing of the interplay between events and characters. They were concerned that the generated
narrative text would not be compelling since it would lack coherence between events and characters
which are referenced within the text (P1, P6, P9). Specifically, they felt that it would not be possible
for the AI to understand the writer’s intention based on the scene outline without requiring a pro-
hibitively high level of detail. P6 expressed that “there are [characters and events] that I’m thinking
of that[. . . ]impacts what’s happening now, and what’s happening now is going to impact that later
and I can’t[. . . ]input every single thing into the AI, right?” They explain their concern that the AI’s
lack of intuitive understanding would mean that they would be obliged to provide an overly detailed
outline for a complex narrative (“input everything into the AI”) which describes characters, events
and the relationship between events (“what’s happening now is going to impact that later”).
28
Storywriters with diminished self-confidence in performing challenging writing roles are more
receptive to AI companion collaboration.
Writers’ confidence in their own abilities in roles like character generation and translating dialogue,
which require an intuitive understanding of context and emotion, influences their perception of AI
writing assistance. We found writers are more receptive toward AI companion support in these types
of roles when they are less confident in their skill but tend to be hesitant to accept AI collaboration
in areas where they feel adept. This sense of self-confidence is distinct from storywriters’ trust in AI
companions described in subsection 3.2.2. Trust impacts storywriters’ perception of AI co-writers
based on their judgement of the AI’s capabilities. By contrast, self-confidence is determined by
writers’ trust in their own writing ability. While many storywriters distrusted AI’s ability to perform
roles like dialogue writing and character generation, our analysis revealed that their self-confidence
was another confounding factor influencing their perception of AI assistance in performing chal-
lenging tasks requiring commonsense reasoning, particularly context-awareness and an intuitive
understanding of emotion. Ultimately, the effects of trust and self-confidence are not contradictory
or redundant, and both should be considered in AI companion design.
Storywriters are more willing to give up control and collaborate with the AI in challenging parts
of writing where they feel their own abilities are weaker. We found that participants who perceived
themselves to be less adept in dialogue writing would like to collaborate with the AI in this area.
This can be seen in reactions to Design 5: Conversation-driven approach, like the following:
“I’m not super strong with dialogue[...]it’s not like anyone is going to read my
writing because I have fantastic dialogue[...]I would be most willing to pass the buck
in that area.” (P5)
Here, H5 describes giving up control (“pass the buck”) since they have lower confidence in their
ability to write dialogue compared to other areas (“not super strong with dialogue”). Likewise, their
weakness in character generation tends to motivate storywriters to accept AI help in this role. For
instance, P11 finds character generation difficult and said that they would accept help from an AI
companion based on Design 4: Character-driven approach.
“One of my weakest points is character creation[...]so I think that having that
[character generation] available to me, would really help me and make that process
a lot easier for me.”
They emphasize their lack of self-confidence in developing characters (”one of my weakest points”)
as a key consideration for being receptive towards AI assistance in this area.
By contrast, storywriters would like to be more heavily engaged in areas where they feel confi-
dent since this helps maintain a sense of ownership over the writing product. This attitude can be
seen in P8’s justification of why they dislike the conversation-driven AI companion design where
they expressed that:
29
“[Writing] the dialogue makes me feel like I have some control[...]the dialogue
has always been mine[. . . ]I think it’s probably why I’ve managed to make a living as
a writer, because the one thing that they [clients] 100% need me to do when I write; I
don’t find it difficult.”
For writers like P8 who are proficient in writing conversations (“I don’t find it difficult”), engaging
in translating dialogue establishes a sense of ownership (“the dialogue has always been mine”) and
they would not like the AI to take over this task. Similarly, storywriters like H2 who felt confident
in character generation expressed that they would not accept assistance in this area. They indicated
that “ [they] wouldn’t use this [the character-driven design] since [they] “don’t have any problems
with characters getting stuck,” indicating that they are confident in their own abilities to develop
characters.
3.2.3
Planning Method
Our analysis showed a distinct pattern of two broad types of writers based on where and how fre-
quently in the writing process they perform planning. See Table 3.1 which shows each participant’s
planning approach. These two groups are consistent with the two well-known approaches to plan-
ning in writing: structured and freeform. Structured writers create and adhere to a preconceived
story outline while writing. By contrast, freeform writers (sometimes referred to as ”partners”)
switch rapidly between planning and translating throughout the writing process to iteratively plan
the narrative while writing and do not create a structured outline. We elaborate why AI companions
should match the writer’s planning method.
Storywriters expect the AI companion control mechanism to match their planning method for
generating and organizing ideas.
Writers following a structured approach prefer AI companions which allow them to guide the trans-
lating process through a high-level narrative outline. They need to do ideation and idea organization
before they start writing. This group of writers indicated that Design 3: Scene-based approach fits
well into their current workflow as it supports top-down planning, with many ranking the design
highly (H5, P5, P8, P9, P10). For example, P10 describes how they would like to use a scene list to
plan the narrative and convey the structure to the scene-based AI companion.
“I would actually rely on [the scene-based companion] quite a bit. It would be
incredibly helpful to show how the scenes are put together and to compartmentalize so
we can see what the skeleton is[...]to then generate a draft. Even if it’s later in the
writing process, I think this would be helpful for revising [the draft].”
Here, P10 describes how the scene-based design would help support their planning process by
dividing the story into scenes (“compartmentalize”) and show the relationship between scenes and
30
the overall story structure (“what the skeleton is”) before they “generate a draft”. They also describe
how this design would support revision (“revising [the draft]”).
By contrast, writers that engage in an unstructured (freeform) writing approach expect AI com-
panion support which does not require the rigid structure of a plot outline as this would constrain
their process of generating and organizing ideas. They need to do ideation and organizing ideas
while they are writing. Therefore, freeform writers would like AI companion support which allows
them to interleave iterative planning with their translating process so that they can rely on the story
they have written so far to guide their ideation. For example, most freeform writers reacted pos-
itively to Design 2: Keyword-based approach (H2, H4, H6, P1, P3, P11, P12). Writers like H2
valued the fact that this design does not “require a whole outline” and supports incremental plan-
ning by generating small chunks of text based on a brief description and keywords about the next
narrative event when they are “stuck on a specific sentence.” These writers indicated that they would
find it challenging to adapt their planning method to write with an AI companion which requires
structured outlining and disliked the Design 3: Scene-based approach (H2, H4, H6, P3, P11, P12).
For instance, H4 ranked this design lowest, describing why it would not match their approach to
planning:
For my own writing style, it [the scene-based companion] would not be help-
ful[. . . ]I’m more of a plan as you go writer[...]and I don’t write out full summaries
or outlines[. . . ]to have them in the future[...]it’s just not me.”
Here, they describe themselves as a “plan as you go writer,” indicating that they engage in planning
as they write. They explain that this type of support would “not be helpful” since it would force them
to plan the narrative ahead of time with “structured summaries or outlines,” rather than planning
while performing translating.

Chapter 4
Tool Building and Evaluation
To build on the results of the formative design workbook study presented in chapter 3, the summa-
tive study presented in this chapter investigates how collaborative AI writing can assist in ideation
(planning) and writing (translating). Specifically, I investigated how this form of support interacts
with personal values ascribed to writing. To this end, two interactive AI-based writing tools were
designed. These tools were then implemented to use the GPT-3 language model. I subsequently
conducted an evaluation which reveals how the type and level of control impacts participants’ per-
ception of both tools.
4.1
Tool Design
Synopsis Writer and Scenario Writer were designed to support the process of writing UX scenarios
[21]. Scenario writing is a particular type of storywriting which is similar to flash fiction [42], a
form of short-story writing, since the narratives are usually brief stories (less then 1000 words),
have a simple plot with a few main episodes in linear order, and contain only a few main characters.
Specifically, scenarios focus on conveying the rich details of interaction between users and technol-
ogy, describing how a user (persona) acts as they achieve or fail to achieve their goal(s) within an
environment, driven by their personal motivations. Therefore, the user can be seen as the narrative’s
protagonist who must overcome one or more challenges in an attempt to reach their goal [71].
Designers use scenarios as a well established, flexible tool to support lightweight requirements
extraction for both speculative and existing technology. In this section, I describe how the two
interactive tools are designed to augment designers’ capability in doing scenario writing to support
their design process. See figure 4.1 which describes the division of labor between the writer and the
tools across planning and translating within the AI-companion design space presented in 3.

Figure 4.1: Division of control across writing sub-tasks for Synopsis Writer and Scenario in
the context of the design space described in chapter 3. Cells are color-coded to show the
division of control between the writer and the AI companion in planning and translating
sub-tasks, including those where the writer has control (yellow), AI and writer share
control (green), and the AI has control (blue).
4.1.1
Designing Synopsis Writer
The first tool, Synopsis Writer, is pictured in 4.2. It allows designers to generate the desired number
of short scenario synopses (around 80-120 words) by specifying a context description (users, loca-
tion, technology, and application theme). These synopses are intended to provide novel (and even
serendipitous) ideas about how a particular type of technology may be used to accomplish the goals
of the target user(s).
This design has similarities to Design 4: Character-driven approach (3.1.3), since the AI and
writer share control over organizing narrative ideas while the AI dominates in the planning task

of generating the plot and task of translating the narrative text. In both designs, the writer is then
responsible for writing the dialogue. However, unlike the Character-driven design, Synopsis Writer
leaves character generation completely to the writer. This design also draws inspiration from the
use of keyword themes in Design 2: Keyword-based approach (3.1.3) since the application theme
acts as a general keyword to control the topic of the scenario.
The interface is designed around a left-to-right workflow with resizable panels. Users specify the
scenario context and the number of synopses to be generated in the left control panel. They can then
request the system to generate synopses, which appear in the center panel. To facilitate management
of generated content, users may add ratings and comments for each synopsis. Additionally, the
collapsible panel on the far right allows users to archive synopses.
4.1.2
Designing Scenario Writer
Scenario Writer, depicted in 4.3, assists in translating by generating full-scenarios based on the
user-defined context and an outline of the key scenario events. The outline input is meant to give
designers more control over the output by allowing them to steer the narrative direction, similar to
the scene list in Design 3: Scene-based approach (see section 3.1.3) which formed a basis for this
design. Much like in the scene-based approach, Scenario Writer is then responsible for translating
the dialogue and narrative, based on the user’s event outline (plot) and description of the characters,
as outlined in figure 4.1. Specifically, the generated scenarios are an expanded version of the events
described in the outline, with full details of interaction (e.g., voice input and audio output) included.
These detailed narratives are intended to assist designers in empathizing with users and exploring
how they might interact with any type of technology.

The layout for Scenario Writer follows a similar design to Synopsis Writer, again with resizable
panels. Users specify the scenario context in the ”Context” panel on the left and then input a brief
outline in the ”Scenes” panel to the right. The outline is divided into scenes, with each scene
containing a high-level description of events. The system then generates the desired number of
expanded scenarios which are displayed in the Scenarios panel to the right. The output is broken
down into scenes, which correspond to the scenes in the outline. As in Synopsis Writer, users can
manage generated content through commenting, rating, and archiving.
4.1.3
Implementation
Both tools have an identical architecture (see figure 4.4) and were created using the Vue.js JavaScript
framework for the client-side components. The current system state is saved in the browser cache
whenever content is updated. Any generated content may also be downloaded to the client system
as a text file.
On the backend, an Express Node.js application is used to pre-process user input and query
the OpenAI API to support completion generation via the large-scale transformer-based language
model, GPT-3 (text-davinci-002). This model supports few-shot learning which allows it to perform
specific language tasks without requiring fine-tuning, given only a handful of examples [19]. To
leverage this capability, a set of few-shot learning examples were developed for Synopsis writer and
Scenario Writer which contain context inputs (location, users, technology, and application theme)
and potential corresponding outputs. In the case of Scenario Writer, we also include the scenario
outline for each example. Lastly, we created a command for both tools which instructs GPT-3 to
perform the required task. Both the few-shot examples and commands are included in appendix
B.1.5.
Finally, optimal model settings (i.e., temperature, presence penalty, and frequency penalty) were
tailored to both tools through systematic testing. Temperature determines the randomness of gener-
ated words (tokens), with higher settings giving a larger variety of words and results that are often
perceived to be more ”creative”, while lower temperature produces output that is predictable and
less nuanced. Presence penalty in turn influences the likelihood of repeating words that have al-
ready occurred in the text any number of times. For settings above 0, it penalizes any previously
seen words so that they are less likely to occur again in the output. Likewise, frequency penalty
impacts the chance of repeating words, although this is dependent on how many times they have
already occurred. When increased to values greater than 0, a corresponding penalty is applied to
previously sampled words, proportional to the frequency of occurrence. One other setting to note
is top p, which determines the diversity of the output. When it is reduced below 1, only words
with a weighted likelihood of greater than p can be chosen, resulting in less output variety. We
did not modify the default setting of 1 for top p since we did not want to reduce output diversity.
Testing for determining ideal model settings was conducted with an automated Python script which
35
Figure 4.4: System architecture for Synopsis Writer and Scenario Writer.
was used to systematically generate 10 outputs for a set of 6 input prompts (3 synopsis prompts
and 3 scenario prompts), given possible combinations of model settings. To reduce testing effort,
we restricted our search to “reasonable” setting values for creative writing tasks recommended by
previous work [15, 104] (e.g., temperature setting above 0.6). Additionally, we used increments of
0.1 for the temperature setting and increments of 0.2 for presence penalty and frequency penalty to
further reduce the number of combinations to evaluate. Members of the research team read through
the generated synopses and scenarios carefully and met bi-weekly to discuss their evaluation of the
writing. We particularly wanted to establish whether the generated writing matched the context and
the narrative provided. We identified concrete problems to be addressed and selected settings which
mitigated those problems.
Based on the explorative testing, we chose the following settings. For Synopsis Writer, we chose
{temperature: 0.9, presence penalty: 0, frequency penalty: 0, top p: 1.0} while Scenario Writer has
{temperature: 1.0, presence penalty: 0.8, frequency penalty: 0, top p: 1.0}. A high temperature
setting was used in both systems although we applied a higher setting in Scenario Writer (0.9 vs.
1.0) since this promotes increased interaction detail. The most notable difference between settings
occurs in presence penalty, which was set to 0.8 for Scenario Writer to mitigate the problem of
repeating text from the outline verbatim. We found that this is an optimal value since lower settings
were less effective in reducing repetition, while higher values produced results which deviated from
36
the outline. Finally, we used a frequency penalty of 0 for both tools since increasing this setting
sometimes caused the output to be cut off prematurely, particularly with higher values.
4.2
Evaluation Methods
I conducted evaluation sessions with design practitioners where they utilized the two tools to develop
scenarios.
4.2.1
Participants
Participants were 10 students (9 women, 1 man) with a mean age of 29.2 (SD = 4.1). They were
mostly graduate students in HCI and were all familiar with user-centered design. They all had expe-
rience of applying these methods in industrial or academic projects. Participants were recruited from
within the author’s institution through convenience and snowball sampling. They first completed a
screening survey to ensure eligibility.
4.2.2
Materials
I sought to simulate the task of writing scenarios within the design process. To reduce the likelihood
of existing domain interest and knowledge impacting participants’ experience, I chose 5 different
scenario contexts, which are included in appendix B.1.5. These are essentially short descriptions
of the target users (personality, goals, and limitations), the general capabilities of the speculative
technology they will be using, and the specific feature the user they will utilize. The contexts
also contain a description of the environment where the scenario will take place. I created the
contexts based on several types of futuristic technologies (e.g., interactive digital clone) that were
brainstormed with my research team. The key criterion for choosing these was that they should
include an interactive component (e.g., voice interface). I created target users and locations to
match a particular feature of the technology. The Users represented a range of ages and genders.
4.2.3
Procedure
I conducted user sessions of approximately 60 minutes remotely via video-conferencing software.
The sessions were recorded and consisted of system evaluations (45 minutes) as well as a semi-
structured follow-up interview (15 minutes). The procedure and interface designs were refined
through three pilots.
Participant sessions started with a short introduction of the tasks. Participants completed two
tasks, one for each tool. For Synopsis Writer, participants created 3 short scenario ideas, while they
used Scenario Writer to develop 3 full scenarios. The order of conditions and corresponding tasks
was fully counterbalanced. For both tools, participants received a brief overview of the functionality
and were given an opportunity to ask questions to ensure that they were comfortable using both

interfaces. They were then asked to complete the associated task using each tool for 15 minutes or
until they had generated 3 satisfactory outputs. For each output, participants were asked to provide
a rating and write a comment to justify their rating. Immediately after participants completed each
task, the author exported the generated text. Participants were then asked to review their work
and complete a Likert-scale questionnaire (see appendix B) which included a modified version of
the System Usability Scale (SUS) [18] and questions about value perceptions. Responses to these
questions provided insight into the system usability as well as the impact of each system on the
values that participants ascribed to writing.
After they had completed the tasks, participants were interviewed to synthesize their experience
and further explore how AI assistance interacted with their value perceptions. The detailed interview
procedure and questions are included in appendix B.1.5. The author kept detailed notes throughout
each interview.

Analysis
For both tools, I calculated the mean SUS score and normalized SUS percentile rank from the ques-
tionnaire data (see Table 4.1). In the case of questions related to personal values in writing, I wanted
to compare the two systems and thus conducted a Wilcoxon signed-rank test with paired compar-
isons. The p-values were adjusted using the Holm-Bonferroni method to avoid Type I errors due to
repeated measures. All audio recordings were completely transcribed to text before being analyzed.
I then applied reflexive thematic analysis [16] to analyze the interview notes and transcripts, com-
bining an inductive and deductive approach guided by the personal values in writing described in
chapter 3.
4.3
Findings
Overall, the designers reacted positively to both Synopsis Writer and Scenario Writer, with mean
SUS scores of 76.3 (SD = 12.9) and 77 (SD = 6.2), respectively. This indicates both systems have
good usability [5]. Figure 4.5 shows response distributions for each SUS question.
Analyzing the value-oriented questionnaire and interview data revealed that designers are pri-
marily driven by productivity in writing UX scenarios. They regard scenarios as a means of achiev-
ing a design which meets user requirements, rather than an end-goal. At the same time, participants

ment to this task. For value-oriented questions, responses to Q11 indicate that Synopsis Writer is
quicker to use than Scenario Writer (p = 0.059, d = 1.697), while subsequent questions show no
evidence for significant differences (see Figure 4.6). The following subsection expands on how the
design of the two systems interacts with designers’ value structure to highlight key differences and
similarities in their perception of the tools.

4.3.1
Both Systems are Perceived as Ideation Tools that can Make Writing Prolific,
but They are Not Ghostwriters
Designers perceive that both Synopsis Writer and Scenario Writer are useful tools to boost
productivity in scenario creation.
Responses to Q1 (S1: Median = 3, IQR = 0; S2: Median = 3, IQR = 0) and Q2 (S1: Median =
3, IQR = 0.75; S2: Median = 3, IQR = 1.5) suggest that most designers rated both systems highly
in terms of usefulness. Specifically, the majority of participants felt that the systems would allow
them to become productive quickly, as indicated by positive responses to Q13 (Synopsis: 70%,
Scenario 60%). Analyzing interview responses provided insight into how they envisioned these
tools would be useful to achieve greater productivity in their design workflow. Specifically, Synopsis
40
Writer allows participants to be more productive in idea generation (planning) and Scenario Writer
promotes efficiency in scenario writing (translating).
Participants described that they often face creative blocks when imagining interaction ideas.
Their responses reveal that Synopsis Writer allows designers to rapidly develop scenario ideas which
would help overcome this design bottleneck. They emphasized that the tool allowed them to gen-
erate synopses with minimal effort. For example, P9 said: ”I could see [Synopsis Writer] helping
a lot in productivity because [the] initial details I have to supply to the system are quite minimal to
generate ideas that are quite rich.” Designers felt that the generated synopses would act as a help-
ful starting point when writing scenarios. P4 indicated that Synopses Writer is a “helpful tool for
expanding my thinking process.” To elaborate on why this form of support is helpful, P3 said:
”What I found is it’s [. . . ] easier for people to start idea generating if there’s already
a seed idea. Because I sometimes find it really hard to come up with things to begin
with, [. . . ] and I think [the synopses are] a great way to start.”
They describe how people (like themselves) often benefit from having a ”seed idea” since they often
find it difficult to start writing scenarios (”come up with things to begin with”).
The designers expressed that the capability of rapidly generating several synopses in Synopsis
Writer would lead to serendipitous ideas, much like crowdsourcing ideas from others. For example,
P1 said:
”I can easily get 10 or even more scenarios [synopses]. I don’t need to think too
much by myself to come up with ideas [...] I feel like 80-90% more productive [...]
the tool is like when some other people randomly say something [...] it inspires me so
that will increase productivity.”
They perceived that Synopsis Writer would allow them to be more productive since it would reduce
their effort of developing ideas (”don’t need to think too much by myself to come up with ideas”).
They liken this form of creativity support to fortuitous inspiration from others (”other people ran-
domly say something”).
Participants perceived that Scenario Writer also supported productivity in translating scenario
ideas (outlines) into words and creating rich interaction details. The AI-generated scenarios were
seen as offering an excellent first draft which “adds a lot of richness” (P8) to the outline. By dele-
gating part of their writing work to the AI, designers felt that they were able to achieve increased
productivity. For instance, P7 said: ”I feel like I would be quite productive since [the tool] can ex-
pand on only a few ideas [. . . ] it takes away a lot of the heavy work to expand some starting ideas.”
They sensed that the tool would alleviate part of the writing burden (”heavy work”) of translating
their ideas. Moreover, participants like P5 expressed that having this draft as a starting point would
41
save a significant amount of time and described their experience as follows: ”it’s easier to [...] edit
your work than to [. . . ] write it down [...] Editing [the scenarios] would be a much faster process
than writing them from scratch.” They envisioned that it would be much more productive to edit the
AI-generated content than it would be to write scenarios ”from scratch.”
The designers didn’t find these tools stepping over their sense of integrity (honesty) because they
saw their role to be similar to other writing productivity tools (e.g., Grammarly).
Participants perceived that they maintained a sense of integrity in using both tools, as indicated by
largely negative responses in Q19 (Synopsis: 80%, Scenario: 90%). This is because they regarded
both systems as collaborative productivity tools. P9 describes their perception of using Scenario
Writer and integrating it in their own work by saying:
”I don’t believe using something like [Scenario Writer] would be dishonest. It is
almost like a grammar correcting tool which helps you boost productivity, like Gram-
marly, I guess. It can help you [...] create better sentences and greater details to
whatever you’re supplying to start [...] I would tell someone that I use a tool to help
me write and to help me [. . . ] rephrase [the scenario]. In that sense, you have to give it
credit, almost like an extended brain.”
Designers like P9 express how they would inform others about using Scenario Writer (”tell someone
that I use a tool”) to help them but they would not find its use dishonest. Instead, they see it as an
extension of themselves (”an extended brain”) which enhances their own writing capabilities. They
feel that they would tell others that they use this tool (”I would tell someone”) since it should be
given credit (”you have to give it credit”) for doing part of the writing work. I explore how the two
tools impact designers’ sense of ownership further in section 4.3.2.
Beyond feeling a sense of honesty, designers also felt proud of the collaborative role they played
in writing the scenarios. Rather than simply giving instructions, several designers felt that they had
been involved in providing the starting ideas for the AI to write. P3 expresses this sentiment:
”Of course, I’d be proud of my friend for doing a great thing, but I would have a
different sense of pride in the fact that I knew I had a bit of a hand and helped them
out. And so, because there is still involvement of me in the work of these [tools] I feel
proud of the writing.”
Here, they express that the sense of pride they get from collaborating with both tools goes beyond
the pride they feel in a friend when seeing them do ”a great thing.” Instead, they experience a per-
sonal sense of pride in the writing, since they feel that they had played a part in helping the tools to
generate scenarios and synopses by guiding the AI through their input (”involvement of me in the
42
work”). They liken this to lending a friend ”a bit of a hand and help[ing] them out” by providing
guidance.
Synopsis Writer and Scenario Writer create a sense of enjoyment in developing scenarios.
In general, a large majority of participants agreed that creating scenarios using the tools was enjoy-
able (Q15: Synopsis=90%, Scenario=90%). Some participants even felt that using AI-assistance
made writing scenarios more enjoyable than writing them on their own (Q17: Synopsis=60%,
Scenario=70%). For example, P6 indicated that they “found the experience [of using both tools]
delightful” and P3 said they ”enjoyed using both interfaces.” Specifically, designers enjoyed dis-
covering unthought interaction ideas with both tools and being rewarded for guiding the system to
achieve rich scenarios with Scenario Writer.
In using both systems, participants experienced the joy of discovering novel design ideas. For
example, P3 describes how Synopsis Writer allowed them to develop general scenario ideas while
Scenario Writer provided inspiration for specific interaction details.
”[. . . Synopsis Writer] was [...] coming up with things that I don’t think I would
have ever thought of [. . . ]And [in using Scenario Writer] I had an idea of a scenario that
I thought would be acceptable, and probably [an idea of] the scenario that I would have
created, but then [Scenario Writer] was coming up with ideas that [...] were renditions
or variations on what was initially in my head, so I thought that was very nice.”
Here, they express how Synopsis Writer inspires innovative ideas within a context (”things I don’t
think I would ever have thought of”) while the output in Scenario Writer allows them to expand on
existing ideas (”initially in my head”) to create ”renditions or variations.”
Additionally, participants enjoyed being actively involved in guiding Scenario Writer via an out-
line. They ultimately found it satisfying to achieve scenarios with realistic interaction details which
made the scenarios “more human [. . .] and personable” (P9). In particular, they felt satisfied that
their effort in creating the outline was rewarded. When discussing their experience, P6 expressed
that:
“It was really fun to see what [Scenario Writer] generated and I was surprised by
how many realistic details it came up with. I thought that it seems like the more work
you put in to generating the initial input, the more you would get out of the tool.”
They enjoyed seeing a useful result with text that becomes richer with ”realistic details” and found
it satisfying that the effort devoted to creating an outline increases the output quality (”the more
work you put into generating the initial input, the more you would get out of the tool.”).
43
Dependence on AI scenario creation tools introduces a risk of bounding designers’ creativity in
ideation.
The majority of designers expressed concerns about the potential danger of becoming overly reliant
on systems like Synopsis Writer and Scenario Writer. They felt that such tools may make the
designer over-confident and restrict their ideas to those that the underlying language model can
generate. For example, P1 expressed their concern as follows:
”You need to be really careful and keep saying to yourself, ‘don’t rely too much on
the scenario generator.’ If you don’t keep talking to yourself, like this and think that
[. . . ] everything useful is already generated, it[...]makes [you] overconfident to the
point [that you think] ‘it definitely covers everything and I don’t need to spend extra
time just to explore because it’s already there’.”
They feel that they would need to be cautious (“really careful”) to avoid concluding that the AI
has exhausted all potential design ideas (“everything useful is already generated”). If they became
overconfident, they indicated that they may stop exploring the design space further (“I don’t need
to spend extra time just to explore”). P6 further expands on the fear and potential consequence of
becoming dependent on AI scenario writing systems as ideation tools by saying:
”[It’s] potentially kind of scary because it’s like you’re caught up in this [...] cre-
ative feedback loop. So how are you ever going to come up with genuinely new ideas?
If I’m so influenced by all the different options I’m looking at [...] I might not think
outside the box. [Just] like I might not come up with an exciting new color palette if I
am looking too much for inspiration from others’ work. If the AI [has limited] creativ-
ity, I might be limiting my ideas [...] the ideas [...] just might be variations on the
same type of ideas.”
Here, they express their fear about the lack of control over outside influence on their work. They
liken this issue to being overly influenced by the work of others in graphic design (“looking too
much for inspiration”) which can prevent them from developing an “exciting new color palette.”
Thus, they are concerned that AI might endanger the novelty of their work. They sense that they
may not develop original ideas (”variations on the same type of ideas”) if they become trapped in a
“creative feedback loop” where the ideas being generated are limited by their pre-existing ideas and
the model’s “limited creativity.”
Fine-grained control remains an area for improvement to achieve greater efficiency.
Overall, most participants found both systems efficient to use, as indicated by positive responses to
Q12 (Synopsis: 80%, Scenario: 90%). In addition, responses to Q5 and Q6 showed consistently
positive responses (Median = 3, IQR = 0) across both conditions. However, data for Q14 reveals that
44
some participants did not agree that they felt in total control of the tools (Synopsis: 40%, Scenario:
30%), exposing an area where efficiency can be improved.
Analyzing their interview responses showed that some designers would like more low-level
control to steer the output and iteratively improve the generated text. They envision that the tools
should write according to their personal style and creative vision. Therefore, they want the means of
control to go beyond the existing mechanisms which only use the context and outline (in the case of
Scenario Writer). P3 indicated that they felt that “the AI [in both systems] could take some things
or it could not take some things,” indicating they did not feel that they had control over which parts
of their input was being considered. To address this issue, P9 explains how they would like to guide
both systems more closely through a fine-grained rating system to improve on existing output:
“I would like to [. . . ] provide feedback on what is lacking in [a] particular passage.
For example, [. . . ] whether this passage is too long. Maybe I can rank the length, or
how original the sentence structures are, or how [...] understandable [it is]. I [could]
provide [. . . ] a quick scale that I could just click here and say like ‘oh this passage
[. . . ] gets] five in length and five out of five [for] originality [...] So for the next trials
of generating passages [. . . ] I can guide the system toward something that I’m looking
for.”
They envision using a rating system to “provide feedback on what is lacking” to rate existing text for
elements (“provide [. . . ] a quick scale”) for length, originality of style (“how original the sentence
structures are”), coherence (“how [. . . ] understandable”). They foresee that this will allow them to
direct the system more closely.
Some participants sensed that insufficient control reduced their efficiency. Although both Syn-
opsis Writer and Scenario Writer allowed them to generate prolific writing with ease, these partici-
pants felt that it was sometimes inefficient to rely on random output generation in the hope of getting
a synopsis or scenario that matched their mental model. They wanted the ability to iteratively re-
fine the output, by highlighting particular parts of the output to update. For example, P6 described
limitations in Scenario Writer, saying:
”I would like more control. A disadvantage [of Scenario Writer is] that you don’t
have a lot of control over [specific] details [...] How would I tell the system ‘oh I don’t
like [a specific] detail’? [. . . ] I would have to just keep generating more scenarios
and hope and discarding the ones with that detail, but it seems like it could be more
efficient.”
Here, they describe why they felt like the Scenario Writer could “be more efficient” if they could
direct the system to remove a particular detail (“tell the system ‘oh I don’t like [a specific] detail’”)
instead of having to “keep generating more scenarios.”
45
4.3.2
Comparing the Two Tools
I now describe differences in participants’ experience of using Synopsis Writer and Scenario Writer,
focusing specifically on sense of ownership.
Scenario Writer allows designers to establish a greater sense of ownership over scenarios
compared to Synopsis Writer.
Designers tended to feel more ownership over content in Scenario Writer, as suggested by trends in
Q18 (p = 0.376, d = -0.934). This is because, unlike Synopsis Writer, Scenario Writer allows the
designer to play the role of director where they guide the AI via a high-level outline of the scenario
events. P1 explained this by saying ”[Scenario Writer] gives me more control since I can add an
outline [. . . ] this lets me create more guided content.” Designers like P8 described how guiding the
AI with their own ideas allowed them to feel ownership over the scenarios:
“I didn’t have any question about the ownership, I always feel like I was in control
even when the system is [writing] there because I gave the starting ideas: the context,
the outline, everything I gave there. It used that and added some more content [...] It’s
like [I] gave it the fuel to really make it work. [...] whatever it generated or added I felt
like the contribution really came from my work, so I [...] was in complete ownership
of [the end product].”
P8 emphasizes they feel in control ”even when the system is [writing]” since they provide the
”starting idea” via the context and outline. They describe this input as ”the fuel to really make it
work,” using the metaphor of fuel which is essential for an engine to operate. They directly tie their
essential contribution in guiding the writing process (”the contribution really came from my work”)
to their sense of ownership (”I [. . . ] was in complete ownership”).
By contrast, participants tended to feel less ownership over content produced using Synopsis
Writer since it provides less executive control over the scenario narrative. Although survey re-
sponses for sense of control (Q14) were mixed for both conditions, the interviews showed that
participants sensed that they were less closely involved in shaping the underlying ideas behind the
AI output when using Synopsis Writer. P10 shared this sentiment by saying: ”I won’t feel it is
my own work [. . . ] with the auto generated content [produced with Synopsis Writer], it’s not my
idea because I did not do much input throughout the process.” Here, they allude to the fact that the
designer only specifies the scenario context (”did not do much input”) and this is why they do not
want to claim ownership over the generated idea (”not my idea”). Moreover, participants tended to
be more inclined to agree that Synopsis Writer did too much of the work, as suggested by responses
for Q20 which showed more agreement and no strong disagreement for Synopsis Writer. In fact, P8
even felt that the system oversteps co-creative boundaries. They said: ”When the system [created
ideas] for me, I felt like ‘No, this is not something that’s part of [my] scenario [...] it’s not your
46
job.” By going beyond the context to add new ideas to the writing, they feel that Synopsis Writer is
exceeding its intended role (”it’s not your job”).

Chapter 5
Discussion
5.1
Connecting the Findings
The formative design workbook study in chapter 3 has revealed that storywriters’ need for produc-
tivity and emotional values (e.g., ownership and integrity) influence their perception of AI compan-
ions and ultimately plays a key role in determining the functions that they want such technology to
perform in their writing process — where and to what extent they want to maintain or relinquish
control in different writing subtasks. But how do the findings in the design workbook study relate
to the results of the tool evaluation described in chapter 4? I concentrate this discussion on how AI
co-writing impacts personal values since this was the focus of the summative study.
Several of the findings from the design workbook study were reflected in the tool evaluation.
Data analysis revealed that designers prioritized writing productivity in UX scenario writing over
emotional values. They tended to be receptive to letting both tools take on translating since they
perceived that this would increase their productivity (4.3.1). As shown in figure 4.1), both Synop-
sis Writer and Scenario Writer dominate in translating subtasks, except for translating dialogue in
Synopsis Writer which leaves the user to add all details of how interaction takes place. Designers
did not feel that these tools were doing too much of the work. This echoes the finding in section
3.2.1 which shows that writers who prioritize productivity are willing to relinquish control over
translating. Additionally, interview data revealed that designers experienced a diminished sense of
ownership when interacting with Synopsis Writer due to reduced control over the scenario narrative
in the planning process 4.3.2. This aligns with storywriters’ perception that losing control over the
narrative would mean that the end product is not their own, as described in section 3.2.1. Finally,
designers wanted additional fine-grained control over the scenario writing tools to guide the narra-
tive direction and the style of writing. This extends the conclusion in section 3.2.1 that all writers
desire some sense of control, even when they prioritize productivity.
There were also some areas where the findings do not appear to align between the two studies.
48
First, designers generally maintained a sense of integrity (4.3.1) when using Synopsis Writer and
Scenario Writer, even though the tools dominated in translating. At face value, this does not fit
with storywriters’ perception in section 3.2.1 that AI companions doing the writing (e.g., Design
3: Scene-based approach) would diminish their integrity. One reason for this mismatch may be
that writers engaging in diverse types of writing (e.g., storywriting vs. scenario writing) can have
divergent motivations. For example, storywriters are primarily driven by pleasure or financial gain.
Therefore, they worry that using an AI to write and then claiming ownership over the writing is
dishonest. These writers are specifically concerned that AI writers would diminish their own sense
of pride, which would reduce their pleasure in writing. Moreover, they are concerned that their
reputation would be negatively impacted if readers realized that any part of the writing was produced
by an AI (i.e., if it did not match their writing style), causing monetary loss in the long term.
By contrast, designers in chapter 4 indicated that their central motivation for writing scenarios is
to achieve a design which meets user requirements. The designers saw scenarios as a means of
realizing this goal, rather than viewing the writing as the end-product. They do not intend scenarios
to be an authentic writing product reflecting their own writing style that would be presented to
an audience. This may partly explain why they perceived Synopsis Writer and Scenario Writer as
productivity tools and did not feel that the AI writer threatened their sense of integrity. Additionally,
designers established a sense of pride by directing the AI. Thus, they acted as directors by being
involved in the planning process and felt proud of the scenario the AI produced from their starting
input. A second discrepancy between the findings in the two studies is that designers did not feel
that their sense of enjoyment in writing was diminished (see 4.3.1, while storywriters expected that
letting the AI take over writing would make it less enjoyable (3.2.1). As with integrity, designers
experienced joy by participating in planning subtasks. They enjoyed generating new design ideas
and found it satisfying to see rich scenarios being generated from their plot and character (user)
ideas.
5.2
Respect for Writers’ Value Perception as a Guiding Principle of
AI Writers
The existing discourses about AI design have been focused on performance, such as speed and
costs, and social values, including privacy and fairness [54]. Within the domain of AI co-creation,
the design workbook study in chapter 3 sheds light on a new dimension of considerations – personal
values. The findings in that study have highlighted that storywriters expect the design of a human-
AI co-writing mechanism shall respect their value perceptions of writing tasks. Previous work in
AI co-creation [80] has emphasized that artists want to clearly distinguish their role from that of the
AI and that they would like to take the lead in the process of creation through fine-grained control
at every step, only delegating “chores” and follow-up work which are troublesome or tiring (e.g.,
coloring regions of an image). However, this is not always the case for storywriters. While writers
49
who highly value their own fulfillment, ownership, and integrity want to lead a particular writing
task of translating, those that emphasize their productivity and financial gain are willing to let the
AI do the writing. To illustrate the importance of considering writers’ values in AI co-writer design,
we present an example of a storywriter and describe how an AI companion should behave to meet
their idiosyncratic needs.
Mary1 is a professional writer who works for clients on Upwork.com and other gig platforms,
writing fictional novels, short stories, and scripts for video games and videos. She depends on
writing for her livelihood. Meeting clients’ deadlines is therefore vitally important to her, and thus
she wants to achieve prolific writing. At the same time, she would like to achieve satisfaction by
producing a writing product which meets her personal standards, satisfies the client, and engages
the reader. She feels a moderate sense of ownership over her writing and wants it to reflect her
own voice and identity, even if an AI writer performs translating. Having control over writing
style allows her to establish this sense of ownership, although she is willing to give up control over
the story plot and character arcs based on clients’ instructions and input from collaborators. When
developing a narrative, Mary follows a structured, plot-driven writing approach. Mary trusts that the
AI companion will be able to create compelling characters and dialogue which reflects characters’
personality and the narrative context. However, in scene generation, she feels that the AI would not
be able to match her writing style. Finally, Mary has a high degree of self-confidence in character
development and does not find this area challenging.
Considering Mary’s profile, an ideal AI companion will prioritize Mary’s need for productivity
but also consider her desire to control writing style, and her structured writing method. Her role in
the writing process should be to generate character and plot ideas and to iteratively revise content
while the AI does the “heavy lifting” of writing the body of the text. Given Mary’s structured
writing approach and primary requirement for productivity, the writing companion should support
scene generation based on her plot outlines. It should allow her to tailor the generated content to
match her own voice, taking care to adapt to her writing style. The AI companion should also
provide collaborative dialogue generation and guided text suggestions which match the style of
existing text, further increasing her efficiency while giving her control over style. In addition, the
AI should afford collaborative ideation to increase efficiency in the planning process.
The AI companion described above is ideal to writers who share Mary’s value systems and pri-
orities. This persona highlights professional storywriters who prioritize productivity as the major
type of user of AI companions which lead the translating process. However, participants manifested
diverse characteristics in terms of the emphasis on different values as it relates to the other consider-
ations such as trust, self-confidence, and writing method. Moreover, differences in these dimensions
did not follow any predictable patterns, and it was not possible to identify concrete types of writers
for which AI support mechanisms can be standardized. AI companions, therefore, need to adapt to
1a pseudonym, previously referred to as P13 in chapter 3
50
the idiosyncratic character of the writer, much like human collaborators who negotiate and adapt
to different working styles among them. This implication poses design challenges in creating a
contextually adaptive AI agent, as foreshadowed in [57].
5.3
Implications of Storywriters’ Trust
Users’ distrust (see section 3.2.2) has been shown to negatively influence their reliance on automated
systems, particularly when trust in AI is lower than self-confidence [63]. The findings in chapter 3
have revealed how diminished trust or increased self-confidence can lead storywriters to reject AI
writing assistance in particular writing roles. Considering trust in working with an AI companion,
previous work has focused on tasks with a well defined “correct” outcome. These include tasks
like controlling an automated pasteurization plant [63], controlling central heating for a plant [75],
and playing chess [23]. However, evaluating the effect of trust in creative tasks like storywriting is
challenging since the most desirable outcome is inherently subjective. For example, a next-sentence
suggestion might not match the writer’s intention within the narrative context, but it may inspire a
novel story direction.
Storywriters’ reactions to AI companions offer a glimpse into the impact of writers’ trust in AI
co-writers (see section 3.2.2). Many writers distrust AI in performing roles that require common-
sense reasoning and an intuitive understanding of the narrative context and characters’ emotions.
They would like to be able to effectively direct the AI co-writer when it is performing these types
of roles. However, much like guiding a powerful horse, effectively controlling a language model re-
quires the correct control mechanism to “rein in” its vast capabilities. This problem is compounded
since writers want to control many dimensions of writing (e.g., topic, characters, plot, language sen-
timent). Improving the capabilities of generative language models and AI writing tools in capturing
context and emotion is key in overcoming storywriters’ existing distrust. Additionally, making
the automated system’s output explainable to users promises to offer an increased sense of trust
[36, 48, 74, 89]. However, offering users a useful explanation is challenging due to the complexity
of large language models. The ideation tool in [25] takes a decisive step in addressing both these
challenges in the field of AI co-writing by providing sketching control to guide characters’ fortune
in the narrative and a visualization of the model’s output to support sensemaking. At the same time,
this sketch-based interaction approach intuitively communicates to users that there will be some
degree of uncertainty in the output text, lowering their expectations for control. Additional work
is needed in AI co-creation to develop AI writing companions that go beyond ideation to establish
trust in AI-led writing under human direction.

Storywriters’ Sense of Integrity and Readers’ Perception of AI
Generated Content
Maintaining a sense of integrity is important for writers who cherish the emotional values of writing.
They attach feelings of pride to producing content that they perceive as authentic and maintain that
using AI-generated text in their work would feel dishonest, diminishing their sense of pride in
their writing (see section 3.2.1). Additionally, these writers are concerned that readers will react
negatively if they realize that any part of the writing was produced by an AI co-writer. This raises
the question: how does the reader’s perception of stories which have been co-written with AI shape
the culture of storywriting, and how does this perception impact writers’ values and preferences for
AI companion support?
We can look to previous studies on perceptions towards AI-generated content for potential clues
to answering these questions. In the case of journalism, readers generally do not perceive a signif-
icant difference in credibility between AI-generated and AI co-written articles from those written
completely by human journalists [111]. However, earlier work showed that they find human-written
articles to be more readable and enjoyable [27], with the difference in perceived readability be-
ing particularly pronounced when users were informed of the article source (i.e., human or AI) [46].
This reveals a potential bias against the AI-generated content. It remains to be seen whether this will
still be the case in the face of improvements in AI language generation technologies. Our findings
suggest that storywriters perceive readers to be extremely sensitive to the writers’ unique identity
(”fingerprint of writing”) reflected in their writing. Therefore, readers may be biased against content
which deviates from expectations. Beyond writing, humans may also be biased against AI-generated
visual art as they evaluate paintings perceived to painted by humans significantly higher than those
they believe were created by AI [87]. Viewers also tend to view a piece more as “art” when it was
created by a human rather than by AI, since they feel AI-created art lacks human emotion, origi-
nality, and uniqueness [49]. However, based on the results in [38], it is unclear whether this bias
exists in all art styles, as participants found the AI-generated art to be more novel and aesthetically
pleasing in their study. Further studies are required to explore whether there is audience bias against
AI-generated content which extends to textual forms of artistic expression such as storywriting.
5.5
Cognitive Models and Writers’ Perception of AI Companions
The findings in the design workbook study revealed that storywriters’ emotional values (e.g., own-
ership) and need for productivity influences their perception of AI companions and ultimately de-
termine the role that they want such technology to play in their writing process. Describing writers’
envisioned roles of AI companions requires different cognitive models. It is helpful to relate the
findings to Gero and Chilton’s discussion of three main cognitive models of usage for AI writers
[44, p. 9]: co-creative partner, cognitive offloading tool, and casual creator [29]. Participants who
52
used their tool as a co-creative partner felt that it was doing an excessive portion of the writing work,
while those who utilized it as a cognitive offloading tool only allowed the tool to assist in narrow
and specific word generation. Finally, those who employed the tool as a casual creator, felt that it
would allow them to explore new creative directions. While their discussion emphasizes ownership
as a key consideration for writers, the findings in the design workbook study (chapter 3) have high-
lighted how several additional emotional values (such as fulfillment and integrity) and productivity
impact writers’ perception of AI assistance. To specify, hobbyist writers emphasizing the emotional
values of writing see AI companions which dominate in the translating process as co-creative part-
ners which would overstep their boundaries, diminishing not only ownership but also fulfillment
and integrity. They would prefer to use AI companions as casual creators for generating story and
character ideas as part of planning, only using AI-generated output as a source of inspiration. In
stark contrast, storywriters who prioritized productivity would like to employ AI co-writers as co-
creative partners to help turn their ideas into words in the translating process and ease their writing
burden.
Looking at reactions to the two scenario writing tools presented in chapter 4 shows that both
were perceived as being useful in developing design ideas by supporting prolific scenario writing.
Specifically, most designers saw Synopsis Writer as an effective casual creator to facilitate scenario
idea exploration without a specific narrative direction in mind. They were able to develop divergent
scenario synopses by rapidly generating several synopses from their starting input. However, as
described in section 4.3.2, P8 reacted negatively to Synopsis Writer since they felt that it takes
away too much control by commanding the direction of the scenario plot and organizing narrative
ideas (see figure 4.1). Instead, designers like P8 would prefer to use Scenario Writer as a cognitive
offloading tool which they can restrict to write narrowly based on their existing ideas. By contrast,
designers like P9 would rather have a partner, maintaining that a feedback mechanism for refining
the output could be helpful in guiding the system. Most designers perceived Scenario Writer as a
helpful co-creative partner since it gives the designer control over the direction of the narrative and
shares control over idea organization, while it adds interaction details.
5.6
Reactions to AI Companion Designs and Design Implications
Throughout the findings in chapter 3, storywriters’ reactions to AI companion designs were used
as evidence to show which barriers and facilitators influence writers’ perception of AI companions
and to highlight how these considerations would be impacted by different ways of dividing roles
in writing sub-tasks. This section gives an overview of participants’ reactions to the designs and
discusses a few potential design implications. First, storywriters were generally receptive to the
notion of co-ideation support and expected the AI companion to act merely as a mechanism for
exploring ideas. This was apparent in their reactions to the suggestion-based designs (Design 1:
Linear approach and Design 2: Keyword-based approach). Storywriters felt that an AI compan-
53
ion based on the linear design would be helpful in developing ideas when the story direction was
unclear, while a Keyword-based AI companion would be helpful for building on their pre-existing
notions of plot direction. Additionally, they felt that Design 4: Character-driven approach would
be helpful for ideating about character arcs, despite concerns that such an AI companion might not
always capture the characters’ complex goals and personality due to a lack of intuition (common-
sense reasoning). By contrast, when envisioning translating support, it was clear that storywriters
had much higher expectations. This was particularly apparent in reactions to Design 3: Scene-
based approach. Participants expected this type of AI companion to take on the role of a co-writer
which would understand their plot outline and other instructions. Writers who prioritized writing
productivity over emotional values were receptive to this type of support and were hopeful that
this type of agent would significantly increase their writing output for both narrative and dialogue.
However, they expressed concerns that it would not understand the relationship between plot events
and between characters. Finally, some writers envisioned that an AI companion based on Design
5: Conversation-driven approach would aid in the challenging task of translating dialogue. At the
same time, there was a concern that generated dialogue would lack naturalness, failing to match the
context and the characters’ personality.
Participants’ reactions reveal the importance of managing user expectations when designing AI
companions. The design for co-ideation should therefore emphasize exploration over efficiency.
For example, Synopsis Writer (see 4.1.1) can generate multiple versions of the requested text to
stimulate divergent narrative directions. At the same time, authors should still have the option to
control the story direction, if desired, as in the keyword-based design. By contrast, AI companions
which support translating should be designed to efficiently develop fully expanded text based on the
writer’s intended narrative, as in Scenario Writer (4.1.2). For this type of AI assistance, the focus
should be efficiency rather than exploration. It is important that the generated text should closely
match the writer’s plot as well as their writing style. In particular, it should maintain coherence
between plot events and characters’ development in the narrative, as well as matching the context
and colloquialism of natural dialogue. Writers should also be able to provide a high-level outline
which is converted into a full draft and request that the AI companion should revise the text if it
does not match their goals.

Chapter 6
Conclusion and Future Works
Collaborative writing with AI promises to significantly enhance writers’ ideation capacity and ease
their writing burden in translating, allowing them to focus on executive planning. Currently, writers
face challenges such as writer’s block and cognitive overload in the complex task of storywriting.
The design workbook study in chapter 3 has used five AI co-writing approaches to identify
storywriters’ perception of diverse types of AI companion support which promise to address these
challenges. Analyzing interview data has revealed that storywriters’ attitude towards AI companions
is strongly impacted by five main barriers and facilitators. These findings have implications for
storywriters’ intellectual well-being, as they describe the effects of the values writers ascribe to
writing. Writers desire to maintain control and express their ideas on their own when they cherish
the emotional values (e.g., fulfillment, ownership, and integrity). Additionally, writers wish to
perform challenging writing sub-tasks themselves when they have diminished trust in the AI or high
self-confidence. Writers are also unreceptive to AI companion support if its control mechanism does
not match their planning method. By contrast, professional storywriters who prioritize productivity
are willing to let the AI take the lead to achieve a high volume of writing output, reducing their
workload. When they have diminished self-confidence in challenging writing roles, writers are also
more receptive to AI collaboration. Our results assist in capturing storywriters’ needs and ultimately
set the stage for AI companion design, supporting a novel writing paradigm with vast potential in
creative writing and beyond.
Building on the design workbook study, the summative evaluation of two prototypes for AI-
assisted UX scenario writing (chapter 4), Synopsis Writer and Scenario Writer, reveals that design-
ers are primarily driven by productivity in scenario writing and see the systems not as ghostwriters
but as design tools to support prolific writing and boost design creativity. Much like existing pro-
ductivity tools (e.g., Grammarly), they did not feel that these systems would diminish their sense of
integrity. Instead, participants felt that both systems would promote a sense of pride and enjoyment
through AI-collaboration. However, the degree of control mediates writers’ sense of ownership,
55
with Scenario Writer offering a greater sense of satisfaction and ownership by allowing the writer
to guide the AI via an outline. Finally, the findings highlight that greater fine-grained control can
improve efficiency. These contributions lay the groundwork for future AI co-writer design and eval-
uation. Further investigation focusing on genre-specific writing needs might reveal patterns that
were latent in this work. For instance, how does genre impact the personal value that writers attach
to writing and how does this impact their perception of AI co-writers? Finally, it would be helpful
to explore the effect of writers’ AI literacy on their value perception, sense of integrity, ownership,
and trust. Another potential future direction is the application of AI companions in training novice
writers. AI companions could be beneficial in an educational context, particularly for prospective
writers who do not have access to individualized writing training. Here, one issue to be explored
is learners’ potential over-reliance on co-writing support and how this might impact their natural
learning process.

Day had dawned cold and gray when The adventurer turned 
aside from the main Yukon trail. He climbed the high earth-
bank where a little-traveled trail led east through the pine 
forest. It was a high bank, and he paused to breathe at the top. 
He excused the act to himself by looking at his watch. It was 
nine o’clock in the morning. There was no sun or promise of 
sun, although there was not a cloud in the sky. It was a clear 
day. However, there seemed to be an indescribable darkness 
over the face of things. That was because the sun was absent 
from the sky.

Keyword Design: Brainstorming
An adventurer is travelling in the Yukon Territory. The weather is extremely cold 
on this day. They are accompanied by a husky. The adventurer plans to meet a 
group of friends at an old claim by around six that afternoon. As the day goes 
on, the adventurer ignores the increasing coldness. They ignore the warning 
signs of the dog and of the environment. This level of cold is extremely 
hazardous without the right survival skills. Eventually the adventurer must stop 
to have lunch and build a fire.

His main flaws are that he is foolhardy and stubborn. He is not adapted to his environment, 
although he is intelligent. This leads him to underestimate the dangers in the Yukon. He does not 
head the old-timer’s advice. He ultimately fails to reach his destination and succumbs to the cold 
environment. He would have succeeded if he had taken into consideration the warning signs that 
were around him.

Character 3: The Dog
His main flaws are that he is foolhardy and stubborn. He is not adapted to his environment, 
although he is intelligent. This leads him to underestimate the dangers in the Yukon. He 
does not head the old-timer’s advice nor the dog’s warning signs. He ultimately fails to 
reach his destination and succumbs to the cold environment. He would have succeeded if 
he had taken into consideration the warning signs that were around him.
This husky is well-adapted to the cold Yukon climate. Unlike the adventurer, it is not 
foolhardy and is cognisant of warning signs in the environment. Its instincts allow it to 
survive, while the adventurer perishes. In particular, it survives when the adventurer 
attempts to kill it and instinctually knows that it must find shelter with other humans after 
the adventurer collapses from hypothermia.

Now I will be showing you five different interface design ideas for software to support writing.
Keep in mind this isn’t about how aesthetically pleasing the designs look. These are all
conceptual prototypes to describe the design idea.
When I describe each design to you, please put yourself in the position of a story writer who
tries to do their job with the help of the writing tool. We expect to hear about how you can
actually use this tool in your writing process. Feel free to tell us how using the tool can help or
hamper your writing practices, and why. Our research will benefit the most from your candid
feedback. So, feel free to offer any kinds of comments, including criticism and concerns.

For each conceptual model:
Interviewer describes the conceptual model to the participant and explains motivation for
the model. The description should NOT focus on the features of the tool like a how-to
manual. It should illustrate how the user will use the tool for what kind of writing process
and what are the expected benefits.
After viewing each design, the participant describes their initial reaction to the model
verbally.
The interviewer then asks follow-up questions based on participant’s response.

Interview Script for Writing Tool Evaluation
Thank you for participating in this interview. Before we start, we would like to
acknowledge that your participation is voluntary. You may choose to not answer any
question that you feel uncomfortable with. There is no right or wrong answer either as we
want to learn about experiences from your perspective. All your responses today will be
fully anonymized. That means we will not publish anything you said with your name
attached to it.
The purpose of this interview is to learn more about how you used the writing tools to
write scenarios and how helpful you found them.
Do you have any questions before we start?
<For the first condition (prototype A), participants are given a scenario context
and are asked to generate scenario synopses until they have 3 satisfactory results
for around 15 minutes. In the second condition (prototype B), participants are
given a different scenario context and are asked to input a scenario outline and
then generate full scenarios until they have 3 satisfactory results for 15 minutes.
For all generated content, participants are asked to rate and comment to justify
their rating. After using each prototype, they will be asked to complete a short
survey about their experience.>
<After completing the evaluation, the investigator interviews participants for about
15 minutes, starting with a series of probing questions based on their survey
responses, particularly in cases where participants gave a very high or low
agreement level.>
<The investigator then asks the following set of post-evaluation questions>
