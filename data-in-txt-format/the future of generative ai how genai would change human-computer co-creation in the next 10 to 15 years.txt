ABSTRACT
The past few years have witnessed a remarkable advancement in
the field of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), a technology
capable of generating new content based on input prompts and
existing knowledge. This technology has the potential to revolu-
tionize the way of human-computer co-creation. However, existing
research on GenAI has primarily focused on technical aspects, and
more research is needed from a design perspective, mainly through
speculative and critical design. Therefore, this study aims to ex-
plore how GenAI would transform human-computer co-creation
in the next 10 to 15 years by means of design fiction and playful
critical design. The study will involve (co-)speculative workshops
utilizing design fiction, followed by focus groups to gather insights.
In addition, this research will examine the user experience issues
of interacting with functional GenAI prototypes through playful
critical design.

INTRODUCTION
Thanks to the advances in deep generative neural networks, recent
years have seen breakthroughs in the use of highly sophisticated
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems (i.e., generative AI) for media
content creation [28]. Generative AI (GenAI) is a set of machine
learning (ML) algorithms that learns from diverse existing content

(e.g., images, texts, music, code, and other forms of design) and
generates new, plausible content [22, 29]. For instance, large-scale
language models such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT have been applied
in cases including but not limited to customer service, academic
writing, automatic dialogue generation, etc [2]. The content they
create is hard to distinguish from content created by humans [12].
Apart from text creation, a user can also ask GenAI to draw a
sketch [24] or compose music as a co-collaborator [19]. It is highly
conceivable that within five to ten years there will be systems
powerful enough to automatically create, for example, full-length
movies.
The research and development of the technologies involved in
such systems continue to progress rapidly. There are thousands
of computational creativity projects (e.g., text and graphic illus-
trations) mainly for non-interactive media. However, considering
the recent advancement in generative AI and other computational
technologies in the creativity field, it is high time for the academic
community to have a reflective overview of the essential human-
computer co-creativity relationship. Based on the systematic lit-
erature review (bibliometric analysis and topic modeling with La-
tent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [7, 30]), we find that the current
computational creativity research is heavily technology-oriented,
specifically leaning on the generative adversarial network approach.
In contrast, design is either rooted in technology or totally missing.
Besides, little attention has been paid to investigating what the user
experiences and interaction architectures of GenAI systems will be
like for human-computer co-creation in the future. The challenges
these systems will have on economic, political, legal, aesthetic, ethi-
cal, and societal issues have remained little explored in a systematic
way.
Therefore, the goal is to foster reflective and critical engagement
not only with what and how things are at present but also with what
could be developed in the future [25]. In this project, we propose
to carry out design fiction workshops to speculate on how GenAI
would change the way of human-computer co-creation in the next
10 to 15 years. The main task of the workshop is to use generative
tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc.) to create
generative comic strips about future life scenarios.
Throughout the research, I put forward the following research
questions and seek answers to them.
RQ1: What are the possible human-computer co-creation re-
search directions of GenAI in the near future (the next 10 to
15 years)?
RQ2: What user experience issues do people encounter with
GenAI artifacts?

RELATED WORK
First things first. What is creativity? According to Boden [9], creativ-
ity refers to the ability (of humans) to generate new, surprising, and
valuable ideas (e.g., concepts, poems, methodologies, recipes, jokes,
etc.) or artifacts (e.g., books, movies, drawings, sculptures, comedies,
etc.). This ability can be enhanced by computational technologies.
Computational creativity refers to the use of computer systems,
such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), to create novel ideas or artifacts
[5, 11]. Human-computer co-creativity is a process that involves
a human individual(s) and a computer system(s) to generate a cre-
ative outcome(s) [14]. Although human-computer co-creativity is a
subfield of computational creativity [16], it focuses on supporting
human creativity [14] while computational creativity researches
how to develop creative computer systems. As GenAI is becoming
more and more mature in complex algorithms and a wide range
of uses, it is inevitable that creative fields will be disrupted. It has
been suggested that the development of participatory AI should
consider understanding, responding, adapting, and exploiting AI
[15]. This is a high-level overview and suggestion for designing
GenAI. However, how Gen will affect human-computer co-creation
and what new interaction for GenAI artifacts could be like in the
near future (next 10 to 15 years) is still underexplored.
The general approach that this study proposes consists of re-
search through speculative and critical design focusing on human-
computer co-creation. In research through design (RtD), actual
artifacts are designed and made in order to respond to specific
research questions [32]. Speculative design [1] aims at imagining
alternative futures and how the designed objects would alter, shape,
and redefine our human world. Design fiction was first coined by
Bruce Sterling, who described it as something akin to science fic-
tion that could hardly be distinguished by a common reader [27].
In the past two decades, it has been gradually regarded as a re-
search method and design approach [6, 8]. Design fiction serves as
a tool within speculative design. It 1) uses speculative elements to
envision a story world, 2) has entities (e.g., prototypes, videos, writ-
ten stories, comic strips in our case, etc.) within that story world
[18], 3) aims at engaging people to speculate on future scenarios,
technologies, or social changes. Critical design, on the other hand,
aims to challenge our assumptions of how these designed objects
would fit in our human world [4]. It is a research practice that casts
critical awareness among designers and customers on potential
harm to the public through design [3]. Playing is believed to be a
way of understanding the world and engaging with others while
having proprietary pleasure [26]. Playfulness, likewise, is a positive
feature in products that increases the quality of the overall user
experience and ultimately makes things go beyond pure entertain-
ment [20]. This provides a new way of carrying out critical design.
As in current states, the design with GenAI for human-computer
co-creativity is underexplored, I propose combining critical design
and play (i.e., playful critical interaction design [23]) to start inter-
action exploration and initiate critical reflections on applications. In
conclusion, research through speculative and playful critical design
allows us to imagine different futures in concrete ways, which helps
us to prepare for them.

METHODOLOGY
3.1
(Co-) Speculative Workshops using Design
Fiction
The workflow for the workshops is designed as Figure 1. Design fic-
tion projects can take various forms, including prototypes, videos,
written stories, or interactive experiences [21]. The expected out-
puts from our workshops are comic strips (including the text scripts
of the comic strips written by ChatGPT and generated comic strip
pictures from Midjourney or Stable Diffusion). First, we ask Chat-
GPT to speculate on the future way of human-computer co-creation
in film-making, for example, and generate the text content for the
comic strips. Then we put the text description into Stable Diffusion
to generate images for the comic strip. Last, the dialogue of the char-
acters is manually added to the comic strip via image processing
software. We have experimented with the workflow and produced
a design fiction example (see Figure 2).
A pilot workshop has been carried out with five participants
(including 3 graduate students and 2 design experts) to gain a pre-
liminary understanding of what insights the design fiction workflow
could bring. The results of the group discussion are included in
Section 4.
To place end-users of design in focus, we further plan to carry out
a co-speculation workshop, recruiting 12 to 16 participants who are
all working-aged adults. Co-speculation is a collaborative method
within speculative design practices that incorporates non-design
experts [13, 31]. The workshop will be followed by a focus group
study. Focus group is one of the most common ways to boost direct
conversations while getting opinions from multiple participants
at one time [17]. The designed example interview questions are
included in Appendix A. The workshop as well as the follow-up
focus group discussion will be recorded with the live stream (e.g.,
Zoom or Teams) or camera recording throughout the experiment.

tures the comedic essence of the comic strip, highlighting
the humorous clash between AI-generated storylines and the
traditional Hollywood narrative. All of the text content in
the figures including captions is generated by ChatGPT
3.2
Prototyping through Playful Critical Design
I plan to hold a brainstorming session within my lab research group
(three graduate students, one Postdoc, and one professor, all special-
ized in design) for idea generation, validation, and selection. The
prototype ideas should meet the following requirements: 1) interac-
tive; 2) playful; and 3) can provoke reflections on society, culture, or
ethics. I will generate my initial idea based on the insights from the
speculative workshops and use it as a brainstorming starter. After
careful selection of the ideas, prototypes (probably three or four)
will be developed through 3D modeling software, programming
languages, electronics, or crafting materials.
To acquire profound thoughts from individuals, I will recruit 12 to
16 participants (including design professionals and non-professionals)
to freely interact with the prototypes. A semi-structured interview
study will then be carried out with them since it can provide space
for the researcher to ask for clarifications, add questions, and fol-
low comments during the process [17]. I want to go deeper with
concerned participants while giving them chances to express their
comments.
3.3
Data Analysis
Inductive thematic analyses [10] will be conducted to identify pat-
terns within the interview data collected from focus groups and
semi-structured interviews. The audio recordings will be automati-
cally transcribed by speech-to-text technologies. All transcripts will
be reviewed to generate initial codes to develop potential themes.

RESULTS
This section will introduce the preliminary results from the focus
group study of the pilot workshop.
All participants agree that this kind of design fiction brings the
future closer to people. However, the content of the comic strips is
not provoking. Possible solutions to this pain point might be adding
dark twists, trying to challenge and surprise the AI, or humans putting
forward the design fiction and the AI adding details. Besides, there
are also worries that AI starts to think like humans, and For artists,
creativity is being taken out. Every coin has two sides. These wor-
ries emphasize the importance of RQ1 which speculates on how to
take advantage of the human-like abilities of AI to facilitate creativ-
ity. Furthermore, RQ2 puts forward the need to make functional
prototypes to better understand the possible interactions between
humans and AI speculated from RQ1.
5
DISCUSSION & LIMITATIONS
During the trials of generating comic strips, ChatGPT was asked to
speculate something bad about having GenAI interventing human-
computer co-creation. However, the AI kept defending itself to be
"good" and tried to give a "happy ending" to the comic strips. This
may cause bias when we give GenAI total autonomy to create the
comic strip design fiction. The disguised AI might cover up potential
risks. Besides, some other problems have been put forward: 1) Users
struggle to get images consistent with the text content of the comic
strips, which causes the problem that the graphic representation
loses value in getting people to think and criticize; 2) The design
fiction of comic strips doesn’t raise relatively new issues.
For the future workshop, the following points should be consid-
ered: 1) Provide a prompt template for easy copy and looking up;
2) Let participants work in pairs to help each other with prompts
while having more fun; 3) Try Midjourney as it allows users to
refer to others’ prompts on Discord; 4) Add a timeline board, and
let participants print out their comic strips and stick them onto
the timeline. The intended outcome of my research is a design
model of utilizing GenAI as a design material for human-computer
co-creation.

CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK
This dissertation serves as a roadmap to address my research ques-
tions and bridge gaps in the current state of the literature. RQ1:
What are the possible human-computer co-creation research direc-
tions of GenAI in the near future (the next 10 to 15 years)? seeks to
speculate on the collaboration stories that could actually happen
between humans and computers in the near future. This inquiry
will provide inspiration to drive future interaction and interface
design utilizing GenAI in the HCI research community. For ex-
ample, how GenAI can serve as a tool to support conversation
between humans and novel protagonists might be one of my future

research topics. RQ2: What user experience issues do people encounter
with GenAI artifacts? intends to provide preliminary insights on
the opportunities and challenges when users interact with playful
GenAI prototypes. These insights can be used as a foundation for
improving the usability of practical GenAI applications.
